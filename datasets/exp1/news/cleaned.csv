The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday updated its spring flooding outlook, including for mainstem Mississippi River from the Twin Cities down to Keokuk, Iowa. The agency said that the threat remains largely as it was the last time they issued an outlook two weeks ago.

RELATED: Spring flooding risk expected to increase as more snow falls, higher temps near

According to NOAA, the flood potential for this segment of the river is ""well above normal"" and flood risk numbers indicate flooding could be the worst seen in over 20 years in portions of the Mississippi.

""The snow water content of the snow is quite robust for the 3rd week of March. Widespread water content amounts of 5 to 5.5 inches remain in place for a large portion of Minnesota and southeast North Dakota,"" the outlook said.

NOAA

Riverfront cities are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. On Thursday, MnDOT crews placed 84 concrete barriers, each weighing 3,500 lbs., along the St. Croix river walking trails and lift bridge in downtown Stillwater.

The barriers are there to keep people away from flood prone area. They're also putting barriers on top of the lift bridge to weigh it down if the waters rise up too high.

""We appreciate everything they do to keep us all safe down here,"" said Chuck Dougherty, the owner of Charlie's Irish Pub and Waterstreet Inn, located right in front of the lift bridge.

Dougherty says this is something they expect to happen every few years, so he's used to it and plans to keep is businesses open.

""We have sump pumps that pumps [water] back out into the storm sewer, and the pump will just be working a little bit harder,"" said Doughtery.

RELATED: Stillwater declares state of emergency ahead of dire spring flooding forecast

The City of Stillwater plans to build a temporary berm next week, and volunteers have signed up to fill sand bags to work in conjunction with the concrete barriers.

""The football coaches get together and we sign up for shifts to sandbag along the river to try to protect the roads, business and parking lots. We try to do our part and we try to enlist our football players as well,"" said Bruce Brevitz, one of the Stillwater Ponies football coaches.

Brevitz is taking his dog along the river for one last walk for awhile, as the trails will be closed until the flooding risk is over. He's grateful though that this closure will help keep his hometown safe.

""This is the lifeblood of town and it's a great place to be and if it inconveniences us for three weeks, it's not a big deal,"" said Brevitz.

NOAA says cooler temperatures in recent weeks have prevented much, if any, of the current snow to melt, and the additional precipitation hasn't helped matters. Repeated major storm systems, which have included both snow and rain, have led to the higher flooding risk, officials said.

NOAA added that 155 forecast points in the North Central River Forecast Center are at a 50% or greater chance for flooding through late May, with 22 sites at a better-than-half chance for major flooding, including a few sites within the Twin Cities metro area."

Spring growth is about two or three weeks ahead of where it would normally be this time of year. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune)

It’s no secret that Chicago had a mild winter, but now the data is in.

The period from Dec. 1 to the end of February was the city’s fourth warmest in the last 70 years and the 14th warmest since records began in 1872, according to Illinois state climatologist Trent Ford.

“It’s pretty rare, and we’re seeing the effect of that,” Ford said. “All across the state, people are reporting an early break to spring. The big question is, now that we’ve moved into a cooler pattern, what kind of damage (will we) see to those early spring perennials?”

Spring growth is about two or three weeks ahead of where it would normally be this time of year, leaving buds and blossoms vulnerable to freezing. Among the plants that could be affected are tulips, daffodils, elderberry bushes and fruit-bearing trees, such as peach and apple.

Ford said a relatively balmy average winter temperature of 31.8 degrees at O’Hare International Airport was due in part to climate change, but naturally occurring weather patterns played a part as well.

“(Warm weather) in any given month, season or year is never just because of climate change,” said Ford, who pointed out that some of the city’s warmest winters were in the late 19th century.

[ Chicago weather: How our 2022-23 seasonal snowfall compares with previous winters ]

Human-induced climate change boosts the effects of natural weather patterns associated with warm winters, he said.

On Monday, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that finds the planet is unlikely to be on track to meet its most ambitious climate target — limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Farenheit above preindustrial temperatures — by the early 2030s.

Winter is the fastest warming season in most of the United States, according to Climate Central. Average winter temperatures across the lower 48 states have increased by nearly 3 degrees since 1896, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

[ Great Lakes set a record for low ice in February, likely leading to warmer seasons for the rest of the year ]

In Chicago, the winters of 2011-12, 2001-02 and 1997-98 were all warmer than this one.

In Chicagoland, the response to warm weather has included February snowdrop displays and the current buds on daffodils.

Unfortunately, the early growth leaves plants more vulnerable to spring freezes. Tulip blooms that might last for two weeks can be destroyed in a day. Trees may not flower, and in turn won’t bear fruit, depriving animals of food.

The nursery industry and the peach growers of southern Illinois can suffer as well.

Chicago is currently about two to three weeks away from its average last spring freeze. In the northwest suburbs, there’s often a freeze in the third or fourth week of April, Ford said.

Ford, who lives in Champaign, is concerned about his own elderberry bushes, which endured two subfreezing nights this past weekend: “I don’t think I will have flowers.”

[ Chicago weather: When to expect the last freeze and snow of spring ]

Around the state, apple trees appear to be holding up, he said, with buds tight enough to stand the cold, but the peach orchards of southern Illinois are a question mark. It’s still a little too soon after last weekend’s cold snap to judge the effects, he said.

As for the likelihood of the traditional April snow in Chicago, Ford laughed: “I don’t want to go on the record.” He noted a recent National Weather Service forecast that leans toward a warm April but said that’s not a guarantee.

“It’s April in Chicago. We’re not going to rule out a stray snow shower,” Ford said.

While we might still see brief periods of heavy downpours, the latest storm to hit Southern California will wrap up Thursday.

Light rain showers over the mountains could linger Thursday morning - about a tenth inch of rain — and light snow showers are expected at elevations of 4500 tonight on the north facing mountain slopes.

This storm was exceptional for a number of reasons, not the least because we saw tornadoes touch down in both Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties.

The first tornado struck Carpinteria on Tuesday, damaging mobile homes in the area with 75 mile per hour winds.

While we see tornadoes — specifically landspouts and waterspouts — once or twice a year, rarely do they cause this much damage. The last time the Oxnard office of the National Weather Service had to classify a tornado was in 2016.

We've received lots of questions regarding what is a landspout vs. a tornado. A landspout IS a tornado. It usually causes less damage than a ""typical"" tornado. Check out this Weather-Ready Nation graphic explaining the differences of a couple different tornado types. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/d235TUXXlM — NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) March 22, 2023

The second incident occurred Wednesday, when a tornado touched down in a roughly half mile stretch of an industrial area of Montebello. The NWS reports that this is the strongest tornado to touch down in the Los Angeles area since 1983.

The tornado lasted roughly 3 minutes and sustained a wind speed of 110 mph.

Videos show a funnel forming, debris flying through the air and the roofs being torn off commercial structures.

Here's another look at the possible tornado that formed over Montebello, tearing up the roofs on multiple industrial buildings, damaging cars and injuring at least one person. 🌪️😨 Watch live coverage now: https://t.co/0YmyVrcwhu pic.twitter.com/T9X7GumZ2t — ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) March 22, 2023

Seventeen structures were damaged in total with eleven of them sustaining significant damage. A power pole snapped and its transformer was ripped off according to a report from the NWS. Also, a 40 foot tall pine tree was knocked over and one person was sent to the hospital with minor injuries, according to Michael Chee, public information officer with the City of Montebello.

Overall, the destruction spread across about half an acre.

""It was very intense. It was very brief. Also fairly destructive,"" Chee said.

We have more information on the tornadoes and why it took so long for the NWS to declare that they had occurred.



What's next

Thursday night into Friday morning will see gusty winds in the mountains and foothills, ranging in speeds between 20 to 30 mph, with some areas seeing up to 50 mph gusts.

Temperatures will remain cooler than average over the weekend.

We could see another storm Tuesday or Wednesday of next week bringing more rain and mountain snow, though the forecast is far from certain.

State route 189 in Lake Arrowhead is currently closed due to possible erosion issues and wall complications according to Caltrans officials. The stretch of road closed is from North Bay Road to State Route 173. Caltrans officials are evaluating the damage and are advising drivers to take State Route 18 to State Route 173 to get to Lake Arrowhead Village.

State route 18 is closed from Upper to Lower Waterman Canyon due to rock slides. Caltrans recommends cancelling travel down through the area, though travel up the mountain is unaffected.

Weather advisories

There's still dangerous surf at the beaches, with a high surf advisory is in place for Ventura and L.A County beaches until 5 a.m. Thursday.

A wind advisory is in effect from 8 p.m. Thursday to 6 a.m. Friday for these areas where wind gusts are expected to reach up to 50 mph — South Ventura County mountains, Interstate 5 corridor, Interstate 14 corridor, Western San Gabriel Mountains and the Western Antelope Valley foothills.

How's California doing on water?

The February and March storms went a long way towards saturating parched soil, filling reservoirs and increasing snowpack to historic levels.

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, much of the state has had its drought conditions alleviated, though there are big chunks that are still quite dry.

March 14, 2023 drought monitor map (National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln / https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?CA)

Reservoir conditions: slightly below average, though they will fill as the year goes on

Statewide snowpack (important store of water during dry months): 225 percent of normal for this date.

Rainfall across CA: 27.22 inches or 147 percent of normal.

Rainfall in L.A.: 31.76 inches or 198 percent of normal.

Most of Orange County has seen more than an inch rain

Most L.A. County areas have also seen an inch of rain or more.

Roadway safety experts advised motorists to:

Check weather and road conditions all along your planned route Slow down Keep a wider-than-usual distance between your vehicle and the one in front Don't drive through standing water — as little as 12 inches of rushing water can carry away most cars, and two feet can carry away SUVs and trucks. Make sure tires are fully inflated Check windshield wiper blades and replace if necessary

How to stay safe in thunder and lightning

Thunder and lightning safety tips You should be safe indoors during a lightning storm, but there are still dangers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one-third of lightning-strike injuries actually occur indoors. Here are some tips from the agency to keep you safe at home:

Avoid water. Don't bathe, shower, wash dishes, or have any other contact with water during a thunderstorm because lightning can travel through a building’s plumbing. Don’t touch electronic equipment. Don't use anything connected to an electrical outlet, such as computers, laptops, game systems, washers, dryers, or stoves. Lightning can travel through electrical systems, radio and television reception systems, and any metal wires or bars in concrete walls or flooring. Surge protectors can help avoid this. Avoid windows, doors, porches, and concrete. Don't lie on concrete floors or lean on concrete walls during a thunderstorm because lightning can travel through any metal wires or bars in concrete walls or flooring. Don’t use phones with cords. It is safe to use cordless or cellular phones during a storm.

It's best to avoid the outdoors entirely during thunder and lightning storms. — hence the phrase “When thunder roars, go indoors.” If you can't get inside a building, staying in a hard-top vehicle with the windows rolled up works too.

But if you can't avoid being outside, here are some safety tips:

Immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges, or peaks. Never lie flat on the ground. Crouch down in a ball-like position with your head tucked and hands over your ears so that you are down low with minimal contact with the ground. Never shelter under an isolated tree. If you are in a forest, shelter near lower trees. Never use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter. Immediately get out of and away from ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water. Stay away from objects that conduct electricity (such as barbed wire fences, power lines, or windmills). Separate from others. This will reduce the number of injuries if lightning strikes the ground. If you are out in the open water and a storm rolls in, return to shore immediately. If caught in a storm in a small boat with no cabin, drop anchor and get as low as possible. Don’t stay in open structures.Avoid open structures such as porches, gazebos, baseball dugouts, and sports arenas. These structures won’t protect you from lightning. Stay away from open spaces such as golf courses, parks, playgrounds, ponds, lakes, swimming pools, and beaches. Seek shelter immediately. Stay away from tall structures, such as telephone poles and trees; lightning tends to strike the tallest object around.

How to stay safe in high winds

Safety tips from Southern California Edison Watch for traffic signals that may be out. Approach those intersections as four-way stops. Make sure you have a battery-operated radio and flashlights. Check the batteries to make sure they are fresh. Use flashlights for lighting during a power outage; do not use candles because they may pose a significant fire hazard. If you’re in a vehicle with a fallen power line on it, stay in the vehicle and remain calm until help arrives. It is OK to use your cellphone to call 911. If you must leave the vehicle, remember to exit away from downed power lines and exit by jumping from the vehicle and landing with both feet together. You must not touch the vehicle and the ground at the same time. Then proceed away from the vehicle by shuffling and not picking up your feet until you are several yards away. Water and electricity don’t mix. Water is an excellent conductor of electricity. Do not step in or enter any water that a downed power line may be touching. Do not use any equipment inside that is designed for outdoor heating or cooking. Such equipment can emit carbon monoxide and other toxic gases. If you use a generator, place it outdoors and plug individual appliances directly into it, using a heavy-duty extension cord. Connecting generators directly to household circuits creates “backfeed,” which is dangerous to repair crews. Leave the doors of your refrigerator and freezer closed to keep food as fresh as possible. Place blocks of ice inside to help keep food cold. Check food carefully for signs of spoilage. Check on your neighbors to make sure everyone is safe.



Tips to keep your heating bills down

Tips State law requires residential units to have heating systems that can keep indoor temperatures at a minimum of 70 degrees. That means every dwelling unit and guest room offered for rent or lease should offer heating equipment, usually central air conditioning (A/C) or a wall heater. — Caitlin Hernández

Use heat smartly to save money: Cranking things like the A/C and wall heaters can be expensive. If money is tight, be judicious about how and when you use your utilities. For example, only use heaters at night or only set the thermostat to around 70 degrees.

Open and close those vents: If you have central A/C, look at where the vents are around your home. Are any open in places where you don’t stay long? Practice opening and closing those so warm air only goes where you need it (most vents should have a small toggle lever). Humidifiers can also help you warm things up — and it’s useful to add moisture into our dry air.



Adjust your wall heaters: If you have a wall heater, you can change the output by adjusting the knob (usually at the bottom). Since wall heaters can only warm the areas where they’re placed, it’s essential to close doors to rooms you won’t be in so hot air doesn’t get wasted.

Turn on your ceiling fan (really): If you have a ceiling fan, try turning it on. This sounds counterintuitive, but there’s science behind it. The direction a fan turns can push air in different directions, and since hot air floats up, you’ll want to move that around. Your fan should spin clockwise to create an updraft to circulate. Not all fans will have this option, though.

2023-03-24,2023-03-24 07:05:03,ChatGPT is instructing a man on how to run a business with just a $100 budget,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/90837/chatgpt-is-instructing-man-on-how-to-run-business-with-just-100-budget/index.html,Technology,"A self-described AI soothsayer has turned ChatGPT into HustleGPT, an artificial intelligence that informs him on how to start a business with just $100.

Jackson Greathouse Fall, a brand designer, has created the Hustle GPT challenge, where he acts as an instrument to the instructions of ChatGPT on how to start a business with just $100.

Fall explains in a now-viral Twitter thread that he told ChatGPT that it was now called ""HustleGPT"" and that it's an ""entrepreneurial"" artificial intelligence that's goal is to take the initial $100 budget and turn it into as much money as possible within the shortest timeframe possible. Fall added some needed caveats to the prompt, informing ChatGPT that it wasn't able to provide any methods that would involve doing anything illegal and that Fall was going to ""act as a liaison"" between the AI and the required physical work.

Additionally, HustleGPT was told by Fall that it would do ""everything"" it says and that he would update the AI on the current cash total of the business as time went on. Following that prompt, Fall explained that HustleGPT told him to set up an affiliate marketing site that makes content around eco-friendly/sustainable living products. HustleGPT provided the steps on how to get started with this business, instructing Fall to buy a domain, hosting, leveraging social media to acquire leads, website design, and optimizing for search engines. Notably, HustleGPT provided the costs for each of the steps and the grand total spent.

Fall acquired the domain GreenGadgetGuru.com for just $8.16 and used ChatGPT to create text prompts for OpenAI's AI image generator DALL-E to create an applicable logo and branding. The first logo that was created can be seen below, and as Fall explains, it was touched up in Adobe Illustrator.

Next was the website. Fall instructed HustleGPT to be as ""verbose"" with how to build the website as possible. The instructions that HustleGPT spat out were in-depth and carried out by Fall. Some interesting aspects that Fall noted with the website requirements were the logo had to be in the top-left corner and the inclusion of a category section set out in a 5-column grid of cards.

Fall then created the first piece of content using an AI image generator called Midjourney. The content is titled ""10 Must-Have Eco-Friendly Kitchen Gadgets for Sustainable Cooking!"" and can be seen below.

HustleGPT informed Fall that it had allocated $40 to spend on Facebook and Instagram ads to sell the products. Furthermore, HustleGPT told Fall to launch the website, which is now live for public viewing.

It's unclear at the moment if ChatGPT will be able to create a sustainable business with the information that it possesses, but I will be keeping a close eye on this story and report back if anything interesting occurs.

According to a report from the BBC, the journalist that received the USB drive was just one of many journalists across Ecuador that received similar USB drives. Luckily, other recipients either discarded the drive entirely or the bomb failed to detonate. The Ecuadorean attorneys-general's department confirmed it has opened a terrorism investigation following the explosion and explained that at least five news outlets were targeted.

The government body condemned the actions and said that any attempt to intimidate journalism and freedom of speech across Ecuador is a ""loathsome action"" that will be punished with ""all rigor of justice"". So, where did the devices come from? According to the interior minister, Juan Zapata, all of the devices were sent from the same town, with three USB drives being sent to media outlets located in Guayaquil, and two to newsrooms in the capital, Quito.

The journalist that detonated the bomb is One presenter, Lenin Artieda, who was injured by the explosion. Furthermore, reports indicate that authorities carried out a controlled detonation of one of the bombs sent to TC Television, while Ecuador's head of forensic science said the USB drives contained ""military-type"" explosives.

So, why is this happening? According to the BBC, Ecuador has seen a surge in violent crime that can be attributed to the growing competition between drug trafficking groups that are battling control throughout the region.

The publication reports that Ecuador's second-largest city has experienced such a surge in violent crime that there is rising number of reports on the number of decapitated bodies hanging from pedestrian bridges around the region. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the number of prison riots between rival gangs that dominate the prisons.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Trent Nelson/AP Trent Nelson/AP

SALT LAKE CITY — Utah became the first state to enact laws limiting how children can use social media after Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a pair of measures Thursday that require parental consent before kids can sign up for sites like TikTok and Instagram.

The two bills Cox signed into law also prohibit kids under 18 from using social media between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., require age verification for anyone who wants to use social media in the state and seek to prevent tech companies from luring kids to their apps using addictive features.

The laws passed through Utah's Republican-supermajority Legislature are the latest reflection of how politicians' perceptions of technology companies are changing — and that includes pro-business Republicans.

Tech giants like Facebook and Google have enjoyed unbridled growth for over a decade, but amid concerns over user privacy, hate speech, misinformation and harmful effects on teens' mental health, lawmakers have begun trying to rein them in. Utah's law was signed on the same day TikTok's CEO testified before Congress about, among other things, TikTok's effects on teenagers' mental health.

But legislation has stalled on the federal level, pushing states to step in.

Other red states, such as Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Louisiana have similar proposals in the works, along with New Jersey. California, meanwhile, enacted a law last year requiring tech companies to put kids' safety first by barring them from profiling children or using personal information in ways that could harm children physically or mentally.

In addition to the parental consent provisions, social media companies would likely have to design new features to comply with parts of the law to prohibit promoting ads to minors and showing them in search results. Tech companies like TikTok, Snapchat and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, make most of their money by targeting advertising to their users.

What's not clear from the Utah bill and others is how the states plan to enforce the new regulations. Companies are already prohibited from collecting data on children under 13 without parental consent under the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. For this reason, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms — but children can easily get around it, both with and without their parents' consent.

Cox said studies have shown that time spent on social media leads to ""poor mental health outcomes"" for children.

""We remain very optimistic that we will be able to pass not just here in the state of Utah but across the country legislation that significantly changes the relationship of our children with these very destructive social media apps,"" he said.

Children's advocacy groups generally welcomed the law, with some caveats. Common Sense Media, a nonprofit focusing on kids and technology, hailed the law aimed at reining in social media's addictive features. It ""adds momentum for other states to hold social media companies accountable to ensure kids across the country are protected online,"" said Jim Steyer, the CEO and founder of Common Sense.

He pointed to similar legislation in the works in California and New Jersey — and said the safety and mental well-being of kids and teens depend on legislation like this to hold big tech accountable for creating safer and healthier experiences online.

But Steyer said the other bill Cox signed giving parents access to children's social media posts would ""deprive kids of the online privacy protections we advocate for. The law also requires age verification and parental consent for minors to create a social media account, which doesn't get to the root of the problem – kids and teens will still be exposed to companies' harmful data collection and design practices once they are on the platform.""

The laws are the latest effort from Utah lawmakers focused on children and the information they can access online. Two years ago, Cox signed legislation that called on tech companies to automatically block porn on cell phones and tablets sold, citing the dangers it posed to children. Amid concerns about enforcement, lawmakers in the deeply religious state revised the bill to prevent it from taking effect unless five other states passed similar laws.

The social media regulations come as parents and lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about kids and teenagers' use and how platforms like TikTok, Instagram and others are affecting young people's mental health.

It is set to take effect in March 2024, and Cox has previously said he anticipates social media companies will challenge it in court.

Tech industry lobbyists quickly decried the laws as unconstitutional, saying they infringe on people's right to exercise the First Amendment online.

""Utah will soon require online services to collect sensitive information about teens and families, not only to verify ages, but to verify parental relationships, like government-issued IDs and birth certificates, putting their private data at risk of breach,"" said Nicole Saad Bembridge, an associate director at NetChoice, a tech lobby group."

Researchers have honed the very sensitive instruments equipped to the James Webb Space Telescope on a planet in a distant star system, gathering data that informs researchers on the conditions of the planet.

The lucky planet to be a target of the highly advanced James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an exoplanet called VHS 1256 b, which researchers explain in a recent press release, is a massive brown dwarf planet that's located approximately 40 light-years away from Earth and orbits, not one, but two stars over a 10,000-year period. The researchers explain that VHS 1256 b orbits its stars four times further than Pluto orbits our Sun.

This aspect of VHS 1256 b makes it a prime target for Webb as the light from the planet isn't getting mixed up with the star it's orbiting, allowing Webb to gather a much more accurate reading. According to the press release, the higher altitudes of VHS 1256 b's atmosphere reach temperatures of 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, and within those clouds, Webb detected both large and small silicate dust grains. The smaller grains are comparable to the size of tiny particles that appear in smoke, and the larger grains are similar to extremely hot grains of sand.

Compared to Earth, VHS 1256 b has much lower gravity which enables clouds to remain at very high altitudes, making them perfect for Webb's analysis. Notably, the exoplanet was first detected in 2015 by the Vista telescope in Chile, and received the nickname ""super Jupiter"" as the exoplanet has many of the same features as Jupiter but is anywhere between 12 to 18 times the mass. Earlier studies done on VHS 1256 b suggested the exoplanet had dust present, Webb's analysis on VHS 1256 b has confirmed these suggestions.

Furthermore, researchers report Webb's observations also show clear signatures of water, methane, and carbon monoxide, and provide evidence for the presence of carbon dioxide. Co-author Ben Biller of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland explained that from Webb's ""few hours of observations,"" researchers feel like they have a treasure trove of data to sift through, with the potential of multiple additional discoveries taking place. Webb's ability to provide a large amount of data from a short observation time led Biller to say, ""There's a huge return on a very modest amount of telescope time"".

For those that don't know, the purpose of the James Webb Space Telescope is to peer back to the earliest stages of the universe and observe exoplanets for possible conditions to support life. So far, Webb is making leaps and bounds with its progress, providing valuable scientific data on various targets within the cosmos. And it's only just the beginning, with the observatory expected to continue advancing our understanding of the cosmos for at least the next 10 years."

Yesterday OpenAI confirmed that ChatGPT was temporarily forced to shut down due to a bug that leaked chat history conversations with other users.

The developers behind the highly popular language model chatbot, ChatGPT, confirmed to Bloomberg that the chatbot was forced to shut down after users began reporting seeing email addresses and phone numbers in the ChatGPT Plus payment section of the website.

Users that were signing up for OpenAI's premium ChatGPT service, which features the newly released and next-generation GPT-4 language model, were seeing email addresses and mobile phone boxes being auto-filled with information that they didn't recognize, leading to the assumption which was promptly confirmed by OpenAI, that the auto-filled information was other ChatGPT user contact details. Additionally, some other users reported seeing the title of conversations appearing in their chat history.

ChatGPT was temporarily shut down on Monday because of this and then re-released with an amputation. The chatbot didn't feature conversation histories at all, as users reported the inability to surf back through previous conversations.

Co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, has now taken to his personal Twitter account to discuss the issue, writing that ChatGPt had a ""significant issue"" that can be linked to a recently discovered ""bug in an open source library"". Altman continued and said that the problem has now been fixed and that OpenAI has ""just finished validating"". Furthermore, the OpenAI CEO confirms that a ""small percentage"" of OpenAI users were able to see the titles of other users' conversation history.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 22:47:00,Push at State Capitol to end subminimum wage for people with disabilities,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/push-at-state-capitol-to-end-subminimum-wage-for-people-with-disabilities/,Politics,"ST. PAUL, Minn. -- For decades, it's been legal to pay people with disabilities less than minimum wage, but there's momentum building to get rid of the practice.

Kirk Langsjoen works at Peace Coffee, attaching labels on bags before they're shipped. When he started his position years ago, he was paid per label, making under $7 an hour.

""I can't stay on my feet very long, it's a nice sit-down job, you know?"" said Langsjoen, who has ADD and Asperger's, a form of autism.

More than 4,000 Minnesotans with disabilities are believed to have made less than minimum wage last year -- which has been a legal practice for decades.

""We've come to recognize payment of subminimum wages as not only a civil rights issue, but something that the type of work for which subminimum wage is paid tends to isolate and segregate people with disabilities,"" said Minnesota Department of Human Services Assistant Commissioner, Natasha Merz.

Now Langsjoen makes a salary above minimum wage.

The nonprofit that placed him, LifeWorks in Richfield, decided to only work with employers who paid minimum wage, and Peace Coffee kept Langsjoen on.

A bill at the Capitol would abolish subminimum wage by 2025. Critics fear the change could disrupt disability services and put centers like LifeWorks at risk, but they point to their own success.

""We were very planned about it, very intentional about how we did it, and most of the employers we were working with decided to transition to minimum wage,"" said Gertrude Matemba-Mutasa, LifeWorks President and CEO.

State officials say getting rid of subminimum wage wouldn't mean everyone with a disability would have to work full time.

They want to work with each individual to continue services and find what's best for them."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 21:31:00,"Minnesota House passes ""trans refuge"" legislation after late-night debate",https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-house-passes-trans-refuge-legislation-after-late-night-debate/,Politics,"ST. PAUL, Minn. -- The Minnesota House early Friday morning approved a bill supporters say will make Minnesota a ""refuge"" for transgender people.

The vote was 68-62 and came following hours of debate on other legislation, which stretched the floor session from Thursday afternoon until after 5 a.m. Friday morning.

The roll of votes in the Minnesota House Minnesota House of Representatives

""In the staggering rise of anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQIA2S+ legislation by extremist Republicans, Minnesota is a beacon of hope for trans and gender-expansive children and their families,"" Rep. Leigh Finke, DFL-St. Paul, said. ""The passing of the Trans Refuge bill will send a strong message to the trans community that they are loved, supported, and protected here in our state.""

Finke, the bill's author, is the first openly transgender person elected to the Minnesota Legislature.

Democrats pushing the legislation forward say it will protect trans patients and providers of gender-affirming care from legal action in other states where such care is banned or restricted, creating a safe haven in Minnesota. It's structured similarly to a proposal that passed the House earlier this week that works as a ""shield law"" for people seeking and providing abortions at a time when laws vary after the fall of Roe v. Wade.

""We have a responsibility to create more space for our communities to live their fullest authentic lives without fear of violence, rejection, abuse or political attack,"" Finke said.

The legislation prohibits enforcing out-of-state subpoenas, arrest warrants and extradition requests for people from other states who sought treatment that is legal in Minnesota. It also bars complying with court orders elsewhere to remove children from their parents' custody for getting gender-affirming care.

This comes as states across the country are targeting gender-affirming care. Eight now prohibit it for minors, including Iowa and South Dakota, according to an analysis by the Human Rights Campaign. Some policies are blocked in court and other states are considering their own bills.

Republicans ahead of the floor debate held a news conference condemning Democrats' ""transgender health care sanctuary state,"" arguing it runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution and puts children at risk.

They raised concern about the long-term impact of certain treatments.

""House File 146 undermines parental rights and most concerningly has zero guardrails to protect our kids,"" said Rep. Peggy Scott, R-Andover. ""It allows children, regardless of age, to receive radical medical treatments.

Many medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, support youth access to care, which doctors say means something different to each patient and family.

Dr. Angela Kade Goepferd, medical director of Children's Minnesota's Gender Health Program, told reporters that gender-affirming care that involves surgical procedures is ""incredibly rare"" for minors under 18 and physicians at Children's Minnesota do not perform such surgeries.

""The vast majority of gender-affirming care is medication-based or supportive services for families,"" she said.

The legislation has to pass the Senate before it would move to Gov. Tim Walz, who intends to sign it. It cleared its final committee in that chamber Friday afternoon, setting it up for a floor vote.

Walz recently signed an executive order designed to protect gender-affirming care.

Finke told reporters on Thursday ahead of the floor vote that the governor's action recognizes the ""urgency"" around threats to trans people, but enshrining protections into law makes them stronger.

""It's just absolutely crucial that we keep doing this work to build these protections and not worry about what could happen in the future. We need a law behind it,"" she said.

A separate bill cleared a House committee Friday that would expand the state's hate crime law to include bias against a person for their gender identity or gender expression.

Thirty years ago Minnesota was the first state to expressly prohibit discrimination against trans people in its Human Rights Act.

Voters next year might also get a chance to enshrine protections for people from discrimination in the state constitution.

The proposed Equal Rights Amendment would add language to the Minnesota Constitution to say that ""equality under the law shall not be abridged or denied"" on account of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, ancestry, or national origin."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) gave an impassioned speech on the House floor Thursday against the Parents Bill of Rights Act, which would require schools to publish their curricula and reading lists online.

“Look at these books that have already been banned due to Republican measures,” she said while holding up several books. “‘The Life of Rosa Parks,’ this apparently is ‘too woke’ by the Republican Party. ‘Song of Solomon’ is ‘unacceptable’ to Republican politics.”

The lawmaker essentially argued that the intent behind the bill, which House Republicans passed Friday, wasn’t to provide parents with more information about their children’s education — but to control what students can and can’t read.

“The Life of Rosa Parks,” a biography of a civil rights hero who fought segregation, is one of 176 titles that schools in Duval County, Florida, removed from classrooms for review, per Insider. According to nonprofit PEN America, the books in review have been in storage for months “with little indication of when they might return to classrooms.”

A textbook publisher used in 45,000 Florida schools recently removed any reference of Rosa Parks’ race in a draft lesson plan, per The New York Times. The publisher, Studies Weekly, said this was done to comply with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ (R) “Stop WOKE Act.”

“In Florida we are taking a stand against the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory,” said DeSantis in his 2021 proposal of the law. “We won’t allow Florida tax dollars to be spent teaching our kids to hate our country or to hate each other.”

While Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) gave a similarly impassioned speech Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez expounded on the troubling focus by Republicans on gender and sexual orientation — and said nearly half the banned books are “specifically addressing LGBT issues.”

“This Republican bill is asking the government to force the outing of LGBT people before they are ready,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “And talking about the rights of parents in this gallery today, the National Parents Union is here saying, ‘Don’t do this.’”

Ocasio-Cortez noted the National Parents Union, a network of advocacy organizations and activists, has been “asking the Republican Party to keep culture wars outside of classrooms” to no avail.

Perhaps most poignantly, she was baffled by those who claim to champion free speech while only working to stifle it.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 20:26:38,Disabled Wisconsin voters say absentee law not followed,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/disabled-wisconsin-voters-say-absentee-law-not-followed/,Politics,"Disabled voters say local election leaders across Wisconsin are not following federal law during early voting in the high-stakes race for state Supreme Court, incorrectly telling them they can't have another person return their absentee ballot for them.

Absentee ballots, and who can return them, has been a political flashpoint in battleground Wisconsin, known for razor-thin margins in statewide races. The April 4 election will determine majority control of the state Supreme Court, with abortion access and the fate of Republican-drawn legislative maps on the line.

Challenges to laws and practices in at least eight states that make it difficult or impossible for people with certain disabilities to vote have also arisen in the past two years. At the same time, there has been a push in many states to restrict rules affecting who can return absentee ballots.

Wisconsin Republicans successfully sued last year to ban absentee ballot drop boxes, and the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court ruled that only the voter can return their ballot in person or place it in the mail.

People with disabilities filed a federal lawsuit in response to the state court's decision, arguing that federal law allows them to get assistance in returning their ballot. A federal court ruled in their favor in August, noting that the Voting Rights Act applies to Wisconsin voters who require assistance with mailing or delivering their absentee ballot because of a disability.

But in the lead-up to the April 4 Supreme Court election, and during early voting that began Tuesday, local elections officials are not following the law, advocates for the disabled allege. Absentee ballots were mailed to voters earlier this month and early, in-person voting using absentee ballots began on Tuesday.

The Wisconsin Elections Commission, which oversees the state's more than 1,800 local elections officials, first alerted clerks in September to the federal court ruling reiterating that disabled voters can have assistance returning absentee ballots.

In recent weeks, the commission has reminded them of the law in conversations, webinar trainings, and newsletters, commission spokesperson Riley Vetterkind said Friday.

""This is a reminder that voters with disabilities are entitled to receive assistance completing and delivering their absentee ballots,"" the commission said in an email to all clerks on Feb. 3, less than three weeks before the primary. ""Some jurisdictions are inserting absentee ballot instructions that say assistance is prohibited, without noting the important exception for voters with disabilities.""

The message called the issue ""especially significant"" because of the court ruling affirming the right to assistance.

""Please ensure that your absentee ballot instructions do not contradict the federal court's order,"" the commission implored.

Barbara Beckert, external advocacy director of Disability Rights Wisconsin, said it was concerning that roughly a dozen communities around the state continue to have incorrect information on their websites, at polling places and being voiced by workers at the polls.

Numerous voters have raised concerns, but all have wished to remain anonymous because they live in small communities and do not want their complaints to become public, she said. It's impossible to know how many voters, or how many communities, may be affected by a misreading of the law, she said.

Beckert provided links to websites in seven communities that had incorrect information currently posted.

The fight over absentee ballot return rules is not unique to Wisconsin.

All states allow third-party return of mail ballots, but the rules around that vary widely, according to Liz Avore, a policy adviser with Voting Rights Lab. Since 2021, 11 states enacted restrictions on third-party return and there have been 27 bills introduced on the topic in 14 states this year, she said.

Most of those would not affect voters with disabilities, with the exception of measures in Arkansas, Minnesota, New York and Oregon, she said.

In Wisconsin, Beckert is pushing for requirements that the right for disabled people to get assistance with filing an absentee ballot be posted at all polling places and be included with instructions sent to voters with their absentee ballot.

The elections commission can vote to change the instructions that are sent to voters along with the ballots, but it would take a change in law to post wording at the polls saying that disabled people can have help returning absentee ballots. The commission, equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, frequently deadlocks on high-stakes votes. And the Republican-controlled Legislature has worked in recent years to make absentee voting more difficult, but been blocked by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 20:15:00,India’s ruling party just kicked a major rival out of Parliament — and sparked a new crisis,https://www.vox.com/2023/3/24/23654832/rahul-gandhi-expelled-lok-sabha-narendra-modi,Politics,"For years, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attacked the foundations of his country’s democracy. His government has rewritten election rules in its favor, assailed the rights of the Muslim minority, jailed anti-government protesters, and reined in the free press.

On Friday morning, it took another major step in an authoritarian direction: kicking Modi’s principal rival, Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, out of office and disqualifying him from competing in future elections.

The pretext for this move was Gandhi’s conviction on defamation charges a day earlier.

In 2019, in the midst of national elections, Gandhi made a joke about people with the last name “Modi” being thieves — citing a wealthy fugitive, a crooked cricketer, and the incumbent prime minister as examples. In response, a politician from Modi’s BJP party named Purnesh Modi filed a criminal complaint in which he accused Gandhi of defaming the “Modi community.”

On Thursday, a court ruled against Gandhi, sentencing him to two years in prison for his attempt at campaign trail humor (a sentence that won’t be implemented for at least 30 days). The BJP-controlled Parliament moved swiftly to boot Gandhi and prevent him from holding office again.

If this all seems fishy, that’s because it is.

India’s defamation law is notoriously punitive, owing partly to the legacy of British colonial speech restrictions. Historically, Indian governments and other powerful actors have used it as a tool to suppress speech they don’t like. Under Modi, these longstanding problematic laws have been deployed as part of a systematic campaign to strengthen their hold on power.

“This government has not invented any new tools; they’re just much more purposive and efficient in deploying them,” says Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They campaigned on a pledge to bring about a ‘Congress-mukt’ Bharat (Congress-free India). This is just one element of this larger strategy.”

It’s a risky move. India’s citizens still have very favorable views of democracy; there’s a potential for something as nakedly authoritarian as kicking your chief political opponent out of office to backfire against Modi. But that’s very much still an “if”: Modi is extremely popular, and Gandhi is not known as an especially adept politician.

There’s a real possibility, then, that Modi’s government gets away with yet another brazen assault on the country’s beleaguered democracy.

What happened with Gandhi

To understand the importance of Gandhi’s disqualification, we need to first understand how it happened and what it says about modern India that it happened at all.

The defamation provisions used against Gandhi, parts 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, date back to the 1860s, when India was a British colony. Section 499 presents a fairly loose definition of “defamation” and what is required to prove it in court; Section 500 makes the crime punishable by up to two years in prison.

While many advanced democracies retain criminal defamation laws, and some even occasionally use them, India’s law is strikingly broad and subject to abuse. After India’s Supreme Court upheld the legality of criminal defamation in a 2016 ruling, legal scholars and political scientists warned that the laws would continue to pose a serious threat to free speech in the country.

“The law as it stands exposes India to ridicule; it is so out of sync with the law in the democratic world on all the major points in issue,” Indian lawyer and political commentator A.G. Noorani wrote in The Hindu newspaper.

In the years since, the political context has shifted in ways that make these laws even more dangerous.

Narendra Modi, who primarily campaigned as a principled economic reformer when he first won office in 2014, has demonstrated increasingly authoritarian tendencies. This has included a willingness to wield criminal law in order to silence his political opponents. One example: a series of 2020 prosecutions targeting opposition politicians, civil rights activists, and academics under sedition and counterterrorism laws.

In its 2023 report, the pro-democracy watchdog Freedom House noted that such tactics had become a consistent feature of Modi’s increasingly authoritarian rule — noting, for example, data suggesting a 28 percent increase in sedition charges between 2014 and 2020.

“Authorities have used security, defamation, sedition, and hate speech laws, as well as contempt-of-court charges, to quiet critical voices in the media,” Freedom House finds. “Activists, Muslims, and members of other marginalized communities are routinely charged with sedition for criticizing the government and its policies.”

The case against Gandhi is a continuation of this pattern. Though initially filed in 2019 in the city of Surat, located in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, it had been put on hold for years — only to be revived in February of this year. The timing is suspect: The Wire, an Indian online outlet, notes that the motion was filed by a Modi ally only a week after Gandhi launched a major attack against the prime minister’s ties to disgraced businessman Gautam Adani.

The Wire also notes that the case has serious legal flaws. In criminal allegations that a group is being defamed — like people named Modi — it needs to be shown that the group constitutes a distinct entity with collective interests and a group reputation that could be besmirched.

“[I]t is difficult to contend that those with the surname Modi constitute a community, which was distinct from others, and that Rahul Gandhi intended to defame such a community,” its analysis concludes.

For this reason, it is entirely possible that Gandhi’s conviction is overturned on appeal.

But to the Lok Sabha, the BJP-controlled lower house of India’s Parliament, that didn’t matter. The chamber acted almost immediately after conviction to kick Gandhi out of its ranks. The swiftness of the move was striking to Indian observers, effectively giving Gandhi no grace period to contest the dubious ruling.

“Despite the ridiculous conviction for defamation for 2 years by the Surat court, the sentence was stayed for 30 days for Rahul to appeal. But within a day, the Lok Sabha sect has disqualified him!” eminent Indian litigator Prashant Bhushan noted on Twitter.

“All to prevent him from speaking on Adani.”

What the Gandhi disqualification says about India’s democracy

Gandhi’s conviction and removal from Parliament illustrate, more than anything else, the continuing deterioration of India’s democracy and Modi’s and his allies’ authoritarian bent.

In 2021, V-DEM — the leading academic metric of democracy around the world — found that India no longer met its minimal standards for qualifying as a democracy of any kind, downgrading it to an “electoral autocracy.” In its explanation for the change, V-DEM noted the use of sedition and defamation laws as integral to India’s anti-democratic slide.

“India’s autocratization process has largely followed the typical pattern for countries ... over the past ten years: a gradual deterioration where freedom of the media, academia, and civil society were curtailed first and to the greatest extent,” V-DEM argues.

But even in this broader context, attacking the leading figure in the opposition is unusually brazen. Rahul Gandhi leads the Congress party, the dominant political faction in India for decades after independence and the traditional champion of Indian secularism and liberal democracy (with some glaring exceptions). He is the direct descendant of India’s most famous post-independence leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.

Though long seen as an incompetent and out-of-touch leader, that reputation had reportedly started to change in recent months. Between September 2022 and January 2023, he embarked on a pilgrimage — called the Bharat Jodo (“Unite India”) Yatra — across 2,200 miles of Indian territory. The demonstration, which evoked a tradition of political yatras in India, was designed as an act of protest against Modi’s politics of division and targeting of the Muslim minority. It seems to have done real work in rehabilitating Gandhi and his buckling Congress party in general.

In this context, then, going after Gandhi poses significant risks for Modi. His regime has not formally repudiated democracy in the way that older authoritarian movements like fascism did. Like similar modern autocrats in places like Hungary and Israel, he still depends on support from a public that believes in the basic ideals of representative government.

Therefore, he needs to sell his government as authentically democratic, not nakedly repressive. Kicking Gandhi out of Parliament does not formally weaken Congress in any sense, and it creates an opportunity for the opposition to highlight the true nature of Modi’s regime.

“This is largely a psychological blow to the opposition,” Vaishnav tells me. “Rahul Gandhi can still command media and popular attention when he is not a member of Parliament,”

Yet for such a tactic to work, it requires Gandhi to translate it into more than just sympathetic coverage. And observers of India are skeptical that he and his allies in Congress leadership have the power to make that happen, especially given the BJP’s increasingly tight control over the Indian political system and mass media.

“He has the potential to exploit his ‘victimhood’ for political gain, but I am not confident he will be able to do this,” Vaishnav continues. “Even after his yatra, pundits said Bharat Jodo Yatra would be step 1 of a larger rehabilitation plan only if it was followed by additional steps to sharpen the opposition’s ideological positioning and build the Congress organization. We have not seen much headway on either of those fronts.”

Gandhi’s arrest has the potential to be a turning point in the dark post-2014 story of Indian democracy. But Modi is a capable and canny authoritarian, and putting a real dent in his political armor will be a difficult challenge for India’s weakened opposition."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 19:53:14,Michigan Repeals ‘Right-To-Work’ Law In Historic Win For Unions,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/michigan-whitmer-repeals-right-to-work-law_n_641df914e4b0f6517fe9c1df,Politics,"Democrats have taken power in Michigan, and they’re using it.

On Friday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) signed a bill repealing the state’s decade-old “right-to-work” law, delivering a setback for the state’s conservative movement and a landmark victory for its labor unions.

“Today we are coming together to restore workers’ rights, protect Michiganders on the job, and grow Michigan’s middle class,” Whitmer said in a statement.

Right-to-work laws forbid unions and employers from entering into agreements that require every worker under the contract to pay fees to cover the cost of bargaining and representation. Unions despise the laws and say they lead to “free-riding,” in which workers choose not to pay union dues but still enjoy the benefits of a union contract.

Republican leaders passed the state’s right-to-work law a decade ago. But once Democrats regained the levers of power after last year’s elections, they quickly set about dismantling it. Both the state House and Senate recently passed repeal bills on party-line votes and sent the legislation to Whitmer’s desk.

Unions hailed the repeal on Friday. Rob Bieber, head of the Michigan AFL-CIO, said the state had “restored the balance of power” for workers.

“After decades of attacks on working people, it’s a new day in Michigan, and the future is bright,” Bieber said in a statement.

Right-to-work laws were made legal by Congress in 1947 and have spread to a majority of states since then, including some with historically strong labor movements, such as Wisconsin. Michigan Republicans, led by then-Gov. Rick Snyder (R), passed the Michigan law in 2012, delivering a blow to organized labor in a state that’s the heart of the U.S. auto industry.

The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said the legislation signed by Whitmer marks the first repeal of a state right-to-work law in nearly 60 years.

With the law now off the books, private-sector unions in the state can once again negotiate what are known as “union security” clauses. These are requirements that every worker in the bargaining unit pay fees to cover the costs associated with bargaining and enforcing the contract. (Michigan lawmakers also voted to repeal the right-to-work law for public-sector unions as well, but that move was merely symbolic since the U.S. Supreme Court made the entire U.S. public sector right-to-work in 2018.)

The right-to-work bill was not Whitmer’s only pro-labor move on Friday. She also signed another bill that will restore the state’s “prevailing wage” law, which sets minimum pay and benefit requirements for employees on government projects, like construction and service workers. Often criticized by conservatives, such laws keep pay rates higher on government-funded worksites and encourage the use of union labor.

Trump’s legal team tried to claim executive privilege to get his former aides out of testifying and providing documents to special counsel Jack Smith, who had issued subpoenas as part of a broader probe into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol. But in a sealed order last week, Judge Beryl Howell rejected Trump’s efforts and ordered Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff, to testify, among others.

Howell also ordered testimony from John Ratcliffe, Trump’s former director of national intelligence; Robert O’Brien, his former national security adviser; Stephen Miller, his former top aide; and Dan Scavino, his former deputy chief of staff.

Ken Cuccinelli, a former top official at the Department of Homeland Security, was also included in the judge’s order. So were former Trump aides Nick Luna and John McEntee.

Trump’s legal team is expected to appeal Howell’s decision, per ABC News.

Howell in October rejected Trump’s claim of executive privilege to block testimony from some of former Vice President Mike Pence’s top aides, Greg Jacob and Marc Short. In that decision, the judge ruled that it’s up to the current president to assert executive privilege, not a former president."

Washington — House Republicans on Friday narrowly passed legislation aimed at fulfilling a campaign promise to give parents more of a role in what's taught in public schools. It has little chance in the Democratic-run Senate and critics said it would propel a far-right movement that has led to book bans, restrictions aimed at transgender students and raucous school board meetings across the country.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who made the Parents' Bill of Rights Act a priority during the early weeks of his tenure, said GOP lawmakers were ""keeping our promise, our commitment to America, that parents will have a say in their kids' education."" The bill passed 213-208, with five Republicans — mostly members of the House Freedom Caucus — voting against it.

It would require schools to publish course studies and a list of books kept in libraries, as well as affirm parents' ability to meet with educators, speak at school board meetings and examine school budgets.

In the Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York promised that the legislation would face a ""dead end."" He said it was further evidence that the House GOP had been overtaken by ""hard right MAGA ideologues,"" referencing former President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan.

The bill was an early test of unity for the 222 House Republicans and their thin majority. The measure showed how the adoption of an open amendment process in the House — a concession McCarthy made to win hard-line conservatives' support for his speakership — holds the potential to send legislation down unpredictable twists and turns.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado, successfully added amendments that would require schools to report when transgender girls join girls' athletics teams and if trans girls are allowed to use girls' school restrooms or locker rooms. The bill would also require elementary and middle schools to get parents' consent to change a child's gender designation, pronouns or name.

Advocates for LGBTQ+ people said the proposal poses a threat to LGBTQ+ students by potentially forcing them to come out to their families, which can sometimes lead to abuse or abandonment.

""It's part of a pattern of attempts we're seeing where the right wing of the Republican Party is really trying to marginalize LGBTQ people,"" said David Stacy, the government affairs director for Human Rights Campaign.

House Freedom Caucus members unsuccessfully tried to add provisions that called for abolishing Department of Education programs in schools and endorsed vouchers that would send public funds to private schools.

GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky pointed to the 100-plus Republicans who supported his amendment to terminate the department's authority and said ""it adds a lot of momentum.""

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice protests, conservatives' intense focus on parental control over public school classrooms has migrated from local school board fights to Republican-held statehouses and now to the floor of the U.S. House.

""Parents want schools focused on reading, writing and math, not woke politics,"" Rep. Mary Miller, an Illinois Republican, said during earlier debate.

Public school education in the U.S. has long invited concern among some parents — usually conservative — over what children are taught. Historically, the term ""parents' rights"" has been used in schoolhouse debates over homeschooling, sex education and even the teaching of languages other than English.

Recently, Republicans have tapped into frustrations over remote learning and mask mandates in schools, as well as social conservatives' opposition to certain teachings on race that are broadly labeled as critical race theory, a way of thinking about America's history through the lens of racism.

Republican Glenn Youngkin was elected as Virginia's governor in 2021 on the slogan ""Parents matter,"" and political action committees have poured millions of dollars into school board races nationwide.

McCarthy made the bill a big part of his 2022 election pitch to voters to give Republicans a House majority. But the GOP's expectation of a sweeping victory never materialized, and even in school board races, conservative groups' goal of electing hundreds of ""parents' rights"" activists largely fell short.

But McCarthy pressed ahead with the bill, making a public appeal earlier this month at an event that featured a chalkboard, schoolchildren and parents who have been on the frontlines of the cause.

When asked about the five Republican votes against the bill, McCarthy contended that ""Democrats are too extreme to believe that parents should have a say"" in their children's education.

Democrats said they want to foster parental involvement, but said the bill caters to a vocal minority set on controlling and politicizing classrooms. They derided it as the ""Politics over Parents Act.""

Attempted book bans and restrictions at school and public libraries surged in 2022 to their highest number since the American Library Association began keeping data 20 years ago, according to a new report the organization released this week.

""We'll fight against this legislation. We'll fight against the banning of books, fight against the bullying of children from any community, and certainly from the LGBTQ+ community,"" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said.

Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat from Oregon, offered alternative legislation that she argued would foster parental involvement, encourage collaboration with educators and make schools welcoming places to families, including those with LGBTQ+ students.

""We want parents to be involved — peacefully,"" she said."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 17:28:55,Marjorie Taylor Greene Leads Congressional Visit To Jan. 6 Rioters At D.C. Jail,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mtg-dc-jail-political-prisoners_n_641dcb6de4b0cfde25cafa29,Politics,"WASHINGTON — A group of lawmakers led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) visited the D.C. jail Friday where Donald Trump supporters have been held for rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

The delegation consisted of House Oversight Committee members investigating the supposed unequal treatment of Jan. 6 rioters Greene describes as “political prisoners.”

The D.C. jail is notorious for its poor treatment of inmates. Still, Greene and committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) have suggested they’re only interested in the plight of rioters being mistreated due to their politics.

After touring the facility for about two hours with about a dozen colleagues, including two Democrats, Greene told reporters the visit confirmed her view that there’s a double standard.

“There’s a very different treatment for pretrial Jan. 6 defendants,” she said.

The two Democrats from the committee, Reps. Robert Garcia (Ca.) and Jasmine Crockett (Texas), agreed that Jan. 6 defendants received different treatment ― except they said it was better treatment.

“The conditions in the Jan. 6 area are the best conditions in this whole facility,“ Garcia told HuffPost, saying the group can spend most of the day with each other, outside of their cells and away from the general jail population, with access to tablets for entertainment.

“They can text their family any time of the day,” Garcia said. “And they’re here because they committed serious crimes and harm, mostly to law enforcement.”

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the committee, blasted the visit in a lengthy statement as a “desperate attempt to whitewash the crimes of 20 incarcerated January 6 insurrectionists” and “nothing to do with objectively examining or improving jail conditions.”

Asked why she joined the Republican-led delegation, Crockett said, “I mean, there had to be somebody that was going to be willing to tell the truth.”

The facility has an older wing and a newer one where the Jan. 6 defendants have been held. Crockett said it’s a bit nicer than the older part of the complex and that the Jan. 6 crowd has its own communal area.

“They legitimately are by themselves, and they actually have a lot more access to the technology,” Crockett said.

The visit is part of a broader effort by House Republicans to recast the violent attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters as more of a rowdy tourist visit — and a pretext for the “weaponization of government” against Trump supporters.

On Thursday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) met with Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot dead by police during the siege as she tried to climb through a barricaded doorway inside the Capitol. McCarthy had previously said he thought the officer “did his job.” Witthoeft told a reporter after the meeting that the speaker had been “delightful.”

In recent months Witthoeft has been a regular presence at the Capitol and outside the jail, where she maintains a vigil supporting Jan. 6 defendants.

Inside the jail, the inferior treatment Republicans described seemed to be based largely on conversations with the Jan. 6 inmates, who were allowed to talk to the lawmakers on Friday. Greene and her colleagues, including Reps. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), said they complained of faulty doors, threats from other inmates and guards, insufficient medical care and lack of access to educational materials or court records.

Asked if she had talked to any inmates not in the jail for Jan. 6 crimes, Greene said officials wouldn’t allow it.

Most inmates at D.C. jail are city residents either awaiting trial or sentencing or serving a sentence for a misdemeanor offense. Nonviolent offenders are usually not held in jail until their court dates.

Greene has claimed nonviolent Trump supporters have been held in jail for years while awaiting trial for merely setting foot on the Capitol grounds. However, Greene has not named names, and she and her colleagues declined to do so on Friday.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department previously told HuffPost that most pretrial Jan. 6 detainees committed violent offenses and that none were charged solely with misdemeanors.

The website Just Security obtained a list of the 20 Capitol riot defendants held at D.C. jail and reported this week that “all of them have been charged with committing serious criminal offenses,” such as assaulting police officers."

Critics wonder where the money is coming from — and whether it helps Texas students.

Example video title will go here for this video

TEXAS, USA — For Dr. Michelle Smith, there is some irony in the new 'educational freedom' bill filed in the Texas Senate.

The longtime public school advocate finds it odd that a bill meant to help parents send their kids from public school to private school does not actually help parents whose kids are already attending a private school.

""I think the first thing that's going to happen is that existing private school parents are going to say, 'Wait, I'm not eligible for this? I thought the whole conversation was that I was going to be eligible for this?'"" she says on the latest episode of Y'all-itics. ""So, y'know, that part of the bill gets stricken.""

Dr. Smith is the executive director of Raise Your Hand Texas, a nonprofit public school advocacy group that believes public education serves as the backbone for the workforce that powers our state.

She says ""parent shopping"" – the ability to pick a different school for your child – can have a negative effect on a student’s ability to graduate on time.

She points to a recent study by the University of Texas San Antonio, which shows that every time a student moves, their probability of graduating on time actually decreases.

""So, for our students that are not economically disadvantaged, the first time they make a move to another campus, their probability of graduating on time is going to lower by 2.4%,"" Dr. Smith explains. ""But for our economically disadvantaged students, their probability of graduating on time goes down 6.7%.""

SB 8 would provide $8,000 in taxpayer money – per student – for families to move their children from public schools to private schools, including religious schools.

The bill’s author, Sen. Brandon Creighton, says a traditional voucher is money distributed straight to a family. But the Republican chair of the Senate Education Committee says his bill does something different.

""For Education Savings Accounts, as it’s indicated in our policy, the comptroller’s office would take applications for the use of these $8,000 education savings accounts, and that would go directly to an approved private school that the family preferred,"" Sen. Creighton tells us.

The State of Texas currently provides schools a little more than $6,000 per pupil. But when you add in the amount that local taxpayers chip in, it's estimated that figure grows to around $10,000 per pupil.

So, $8,000 is the median between those sets of numbers.

But Sen. Creighton says, more importantly, they had to find a figure that wouldn’t hold the budget or lawmakers hostage in the future.

""For the $8,000, we just looked at a number that, from a scarcity of dollars standpoint, we could comfortably justify in this budget to not create any kind of a fiscal cliff,"" the Republican says. ""We look at surpluses cautiously because we can’t obligate future legislatures or budgets to money that won't be there in the future.""

Dr. Smith argues the $8,000 provided by the state will not give parents many choice options. And since rural communities in Texas are already short on private schools, if SB 8 is passed, she sees that changing – but not for the better.

""They may not have private schools right now, but there could be a little micro school or a strip mall school or whatever that pops up that miraculously will be $8,000 a year, when in reality most of our really high, high quality private schools in Texas are costing $20,000, $30,000 a year,"" Dr. Smith argues. ""And normal families are just not going to be able to access those really high quality private schools.""

The idea of school choice has fizzled in past legislative sessions due to strong opposition from Democrats, who often represent urban school districts, and rural Republicans, who want to protect the public schools in their districts, which are often the largest employers.

But SB 8 offers an enticement to those rural Republicans. Any district with fewer than 20,000 students would receive $10,000 per student who left a public school for a private school. And this carve-out for districts would last for two years.

Sen. Creighton says his bill will help districts ""scale"" the impact for any student leaving until they get their feet under them – a ""soft landing"" as he calls it for medium to smaller districts.

While Dr. Smith says she opposes the bill, she does admit it contains some provisions that could help some parents who are stuck with a bad school, such as making it easier to transfer within a district or to another district.

But, overall, she doesn’t think SB 8 will pass.

""As the bill is currently filed, it doesn’t have the votes,"" she says. ""It just isn’t going to get to the finish. Y'know, it may get through the Senate, but it won’t get through the House.""

For his part, Senator Creighton tells us the momentum is strong and growing – but he concedes that hasn’t counted heads yet, so it’s not clear yet if his bill does have the backing he thinks it does.

Still, the longtime education advocate is adamant Texas can do all of this at the same time.

""Anyone that creates a narrative that you can’t lift up public schools and teachers and also provide educational empowerment for families is just creating a narrative that’s false and divisive,"" says Sen. Creighton. ""We’re going to be able to accomplish both. And I think the membership will get there."""

Lindsey Graham for campaign solicitations,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-graham-admonished-by-senate-ethics/,Politics,"FILE: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 16, 2022. Alex Brandon / AP

The Senate Ethics Committee is admonishing South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham for soliciting campaign contributions inside a federal building after a Nov. 2022 Fox News interview in which he asked viewers to donate to a GOP candidate.

Graham violated Senate rules and standards of conduct because he was in a Senate office building when he gave the interview, the leaders of the ethics panel said in a rare public letter released on Thursday.

""The public must feel confident that Members use public resources only for official actions in the best interests of the United States, not for partisan political activity,"" wrote Senate Ethics Committee Chairman Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the panel's Republican vice chairman. ""Your actions failed to uphold that standard, resulting in harm to the public trust and confidence in the United States Senate. You are hereby admonished.""

Coons and Lankford wrote that Graham solicited campaign contributions for Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker's campaign committee ""five separate times"" during the Nov. 30, 2022 interview on Fox News. They noted that Graham reported himself to the committee after the interview was over.

In a statement Thursday, Graham said: ""It was a mistake. I take responsibility. I will try to do better in the future.""

It is unclear if Graham could face any criminal penalties for his actions. Coons and Lankford said this was the senator's second violation, after he had similarly solicited campaign contributions for his own campaign during an unplanned hallway interview in 2020.

The ethics committee dismissed that complaint and notified Graham in a private letter, Coons and Lankford wrote. The panel did not publicly reveal that violation until now, having determined at the time that his conduct was ""inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature,"" the letter said.

The prohibitions on campaign solicitation in federal buildings and the use of federal resources for campaign activity ""have been consistent and clear throughout your years of Senate service,"" they wrote, and Graham solicited the campaign contributions in the November interview ""despite the Committee's specific guidance following your violation in October 2020."""

As Visual Capitalist’s Govind Bhutada details, besides investors and jewelry consumers, central banks are a major source of gold demand. In fact, in 2022, central banks snapped up gold at the fastest pace since 1967.

However, the record gold purchases of 2022 are in stark contrast to the 1990s and early 2000s, when central banks were net sellers of gold. The below infographic (learn more here) uses data from the World Gold Council to show 30 years of central bank gold demand, highlighting how official attitudes toward gold have changed in the last 30 years.

This infographic doesn’t need much commentary. Central banks know all too well that they are currency debasing at record rates and are preparing for the eventual implosion. If they really believe that inflation is well in check, why are they buying so much gold?

If central banks are preparing for this implosion, shouldn’t you also do so?

2023-03-24,2023-03-24 03:52:06,Kids to require parental consent to access social media apps under new Utah law,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/utah-law-social-media-apps-parental-consent/,Politics,"Children and teenagers in Utah are to lose access to social media apps such as TikTok if they don't have parental consent and would face other restrictions under a first-in-the-nation law designed to shield young people from the addictive apps.

The two bills Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed into law also prohibit kids under 18 from using social media between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., require age verification for anyone who wants to use social media in the state and seek to prevent tech companies from luring kids to their apps using addictive features.

The laws passed through Utah's GOP-supermajority Legislature reflect changing perceptions of both Democrats and Republicans toward technology companies.

Tech giants like Facebook and Google have enjoyed unbridled growth for over a decade, but amid concerns over user privacy, hate speech, misinformation and harmful effects on teens' mental health, lawmakers have begun trying to rein them in. Utah's law was signed on the same day TikTok's CEO testified before Congress about, among other things, the app's effects on teenagers' mental health.

But legislation has stalled on the federal level, pushing states to step in.

Other Republican-leaning states, such as Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Louisiana, have similar proposals in the works, along with New Jersey. California, meanwhile, enacted a law last year requiring tech companies to put kids' safety first by barring them from profiling children or using personal information in ways that could harm children physically or mentally.

In addition to the parental consent provisions, social media companies would likely have to design new features to comply with parts of the law to prohibit promoting ads to minors and showing them in search results. Tech companies like TikTok, Snapchat and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, make most of their money by targeting advertising to their users.

What's not clear from the Utah bill and others is how the states plan to enforce the new regulations. Companies are already prohibited from collecting data on children under 13 without parental consent under the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. For this reason, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms — but children can easily get around it, both with and without their parents' consent.

Cox said studies have shown that time spent on social media leads to ""poor mental health outcomes"" for children.

""We remain very optimistic that we will be able to pass not just here in the state of Utah but across the country legislation that significantly changes the relationship of our children with these very destructive social media apps,"" he said.

Children's advocacy groups generally welcomed the law, albeit with some caveats. Common Sense Media, a nonprofit focusing on kids and technology, hailed the law aimed at reining in social media's addictive features. It ""adds momentum for other states to hold social media companies accountable to ensure kids across the country are protected online,"" said Jim Steyer, the CEO and founder of Common Sense.

He pointed to similar legislation in the works in California and New Jersey — and said the safety and mental well-being of kids and teens depend on legislation like this to hold big tech accountable for creating safer and healthier experiences online.

But Steyer said the other bill Cox signed giving parents access to children's social media posts would ""deprive kids of the online privacy protections we advocate for. The law also requires age verification and parental consent for minors to create a social media account, which doesn't get to the root of the problem – kids and teens will still be exposed to companies' harmful data collection and design practices once they are on the platform.""

The laws are the latest effort from Utah lawmakers focused on children and the information they can access online. Two years ago, Cox signed legislation that called on tech companies to automatically block porn on cell phones and tablets sold, citing the dangers it posed to children. Amid concerns about enforcement, lawmakers in the deeply religious state revised the bill to prevent it from taking effect unless five other states passed similar laws.

The social media regulations come as parents and lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about kids and teenagers' use and how platforms like TikTok, Instagram and others are affecting young people's mental health.

It is set to take effect in March 2024, and Cox has previously said he anticipates social media companies will challenge it in court.

Tech industry lobbyists quickly decried the laws as unconstitutional, saying they infringe on people's right to exercise the First Amendment online.

""Utah will soon require online services to collect sensitive information about teens and families, not only to verify ages, but to verify parental relationships, like government-issued IDs and birth certificates, putting their private data at risk of breach,"" said Nicole Saad Bembridge, an associate director at NetChoice, a tech lobby group."
2023-03-24,2023-03-24 02:38:00,House intel panel chairman says ban or sale of TikTok appears inevitable,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-congress-hearing-gop-commitee-sale-ban-inevitable/,Politics,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, asked by CBS News if banning TikTok in the U.S. was inevitable, responded ""yes;"" he also said that assurances by the company's chief executive that American user data is insulated from Chinese authorities were ""unbelievable."" But Turner suggested a sale of the company could assuage national security concerns.

Turner said in an interview that he did not believe the social media company could ""continue to operate in the manner which they are, long term.""

The Ohio Republican's comments followed Thursday's testimony by TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew, who was grilled by members of both parties on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

""What we know is companies that are controlled by China are, of course, controlled by the Communist Party in China,"" said Turner. ""There's no division, as there is in our country between government and commerce. This really is something that everyone should be concerned about because whenever they download the TikTok app, they are surrendering access to data and information that could go right in the hands of the Communist Party in China.""

Turner, a member of the congressional Gang of Eight, which is briefed on the most sensitive government intelligence, predicted major changes for the app, which has 150 million U.S. users.

He said divestiture — or selling the company — might resolve his national security concerns, but it would depend on the structure and details.

""I do believe that a divestiture, a ban, something will have to happen to address this issue because it is far too great of a security concern,"" Turner said. ""You're seeing governments beyond just our own ban the use of the TikTok app on their government equipment. That's because they, on their own, have come to the determination that that app represents a security threat to their nation and to their nations' data. Individuals should be making the same conclusion that this is a risk to them also.""

Asked how much damage has been done to American user data by TikTok, Turner said, ""It's more of a vulnerability than damage. But I do think that there is a rising damage that we have to be concerned about that certainly has national security implications.""

Turner added that in his mind, there was no separation between TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party."
2023-03-24,2023-03-24 01:07:00,Proud Boys trial disrupted after defense says its witness was paid FBI informant,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/proud-boys-trial-defense-witness-paid-fbi-informant/,Politics,"Washington — Prosecutors in the trial of the Proud Boys conceded Thursday that a witness to be called by the defense had previously been paid by the FBI as a confidential informant in the months before five members of the far-right group were to be tried for seditious conspiracy.

According to court documents filed late Wednesday by defendant Zachary Rehl, between April 2022 and January 2023, the unnamed female FBI informant was ""in contact via telephone, text messaging and other electronic means, with one or more of the counsel for the defense and at least one defendant.""

Prosecutors say the FBI ended its relationship with the informant upon learning in January that she might be called as a defense witness, in order to ensure she did not provide information about the case to government and violate any defendant's attorney-client privilege. Confidential human sources are a tool used by federal investigators to obtain information and their identities are usually protected.

Rehl and four members of the Proud Boys — including leader Enrique Tarrio — are currently on trial for attempting to use force to prevent the peaceful transfer of power from former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. All of them have pleaded not guilty.

In court on Thursday, attorneys for Tarrio revealed they intended to call the anonymous witness, but they grew concerned after prosecutors told them she had previously acted as a confidential human source for federal investigators.

Court papers revealed the informant had allegedly attended prayer meetings with ""one or more"" of the defendants' families.

""The government disclosed this information for the first time on the day before the witness was scheduled to appear,"" Rehl's attorney alleged in court documents.

Prosecutors said in court on Thursday they had only recently discovered that the informant would be called as a witness in Tarrio's defense and informed the defense as soon as the law required. The Justice Department wrote in court filings that it ""neither relied upon any evidence from nor referenced the [individual] in question"" when preparing their case against Tarrio and his codefendants.

""The FBI never tasked the [informant] with gathering any information on the defendants or their defense counsel,"" prosecutors wrote. ""And although the FBI was generally aware that the [confidential human source (CHS)] was active in assisting defendants charged with crimes related to the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and their families, including by assisting in fundraising efforts and protesting against their conditions of confinement, the FBI intentionally chose to never ask the CHS about her relationship with defendant Enrique Tarrio or any of the other defendants or counsel.""

""There has been no intrusion on the defense camp, and no such records or recordings exist.""

During Thursday's proceedings before Judge Timothy Kelly, which were conducted outside the presence of the jury, defense attorneys called the revelations ""stunning."" Some asked for a fact-finding hearing, and others argued the trial should be paused.

Kelly said he would not halt the trial and instead instructed the parties to raise any issues regarding the witness in real time. Tarrio's lawyers say they still intend to call her to testify.

The judge said although he understood the defendants' concerns, the record before him indicated that no defendants or attorneys had been implicated by the informant's relationship with the FBI and that government's legal team on the Proud Boys case had not been aware of the arrangement. Prosecutors have turned records over to the judge from the informant's relationship with investigators.

The high-profile criminal trial is currently nearing the end of its second month. Prosecutors rested their case last week after calling dozens of witnesses, including former members of the far-right group who had agreed to cooperate.

Defense testimony is scheduled to resume on Friday."

""We're getting 500,000 applications a week for a passport. That's 30 to 40% above last year, so it's dramatic,"" Blinken said in response to a question about extended wait times for U.S. passport renewals and visa applications during a House Appropriations subcommittee budget hearing.

During the pandemic, the ""bottom basically dropped out of the system,"" Blinken said, and ""demand went way down."" Since the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, travel has roared back, with 52% of all Americans planning to travel in the next six months, said the U.S. Travel Association, a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote travel to and within the U.S.

A record number of passports — 22 million — were issued in fiscal year 2022. Blinken said the State Department is ""on track to break"" that record in 2023.

Blinken said the State Department has made a concerted effort to boost its staffing and resources dedicated to processing passport and visa applications after having to cut back during the height of the pandemic.

""I have a task force established at headquarters to marshall all of these efforts so that we're really digging in on this,"" Blinken said. ""We're authorizing overtime, we've opened satellite offices.""

""I think it's really important that we be as clear and transparent as possible with people who are looking for passports to know what they can expect,"" he added.

Blinken said the standard processing time for a passport currently ""takes about 10 to 13 weeks"" and an expedited request takes roughly ""seven to nine weeks."" These processing times only apply to new applications submitted on or after March 24, the State Department said in a news release. Processing time begins the day an application is received and does not include mailing time, the statement read.

In 2022, the State Department launched an online renewal pilot because, Blinken said, passport holders should be able to renew online ""and not have to come in the passport center with all the resources that requires.""

""We expect that 65% of renewal customers for passports will be able to do so online once this program is fully up and running on the visa side,"" Blinken said.

Delay times for visas have started to recede, Blinken said. Global wait times are two months in most places, half of what it was a year ago, he said. The State Department is prioritizing visas that have an economic impact, particularly for students, temporary workers, business travelers and maritime crews."

Example video title will go here for this video

WASHINGTON — The U.S. House failed Thursday to override President Joe Biden's first veto — of a Republican-led bill that would have banned the consideration of environmental, social or governance issues in retirement and other investment decisions.

Republicans failed to mount the necessary two-thirds votes needed in the House to override the president's veto of the “ESG” investment bill. The override failed on a 219-200 vote mostly along party lines as most Democrats opposed.

The standoff was a first test of the strength of the new Republican majority in the House as it confronts the Democratic president in the White House.

House Republicans had succeeded in passing the legislation through Congress last month, part of their agenda to undo so-called “woke” government policies that strive to bring new ways of thinking about social and environmental issues with equity and accountability.

The legislation was a pushback against the idea of “ESG” investing, which takes into account a company's environmental social and governance record, including on issues like climate change.

Including such factors in financial planning has gained in popularity as Americans seek different options for where they park their retirement savings and other investments.

The U.S. Department of Labor had issued a rule last December saying investment plan fiduciaries may consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors in making investment decisions.

But the newly empowered House Republicans sought to roll back the Labor Department rule and effectively reinstate a Trump-era policy banning the investment practice. The measure gained some support in the Democratic-held Senate."

The federal corruption trial of suspended Los Angeles City Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas is now in the hands of the jury. The prosecution and defense made their closing arguments Thursday, and the prosecution completed its rebuttal argument Friday morning.

Ridley-Thomas is charged with one count of conspiracy, and one count of bribery. He also is charged with two counts of “honest services” mail fraud and 15 counts of “honest services” wire fraud.

In her summation Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindsey Dotson acknowledged there was no single document that laid out a conspiracy between Ridley-Thomas and Marilyn Flynn, dean of USC’s School of Social Work. The conspiracy allegedly involved Ridley-Thomas securing lucrative county contracts for the school in exchange for the dean providing his son with a scholarship and faculty job. The alleged crimes occurred while Ridley-Thomas was a county supervisor.

But Dotson pointed to a flurry of emails and calls between Ridley-Thomas and Flynn starting in 2017 and running through 2018 that revealed “winks and nods” — including one email with a winking emoji and another with a fist bump emoji.

There is “no question he acted corruptly,” Dotson said of Ridley-Thomas. The fact that the county approved the contract for USC and Ridley-Thomas’ son Sebastian got a scholarship and a job with the school “is not a coincidence,” she said.

‘Winks and nods work’

Just the suggestion of an exchange of benefits is enough, said Dotson, asserting, “winks and nods work. That’s how the real world works.”

In one email, Ridley-Thomas told Flynn, “Your wish is my command,” the prosecutor said.

Dotson said Ridley-Thomas was ""constantly dangling county carrots to Marilyn Flynn” at a time when the School of Social Work was in financial trouble.

Dotson referred to an email Flynn wrote to a colleague regarding potential money for the university in which Flynn wrote, ”I’m holding my breath. MRT is really trying to deliver here.”

Prosecutors also claim that as part of their deal, Flynn agreed to funnel $100,000 from a Ridley-Thomas political campaign fund through the School of Social Work to a new nonprofit headed by his son.

Flynn pleaded guilty to bribery last September, admitting she agreed to route the money to the nonprofit as a result of her desire to win county approval of a renewed contract for USC’s online mental health clinic.

Dotson spent considerable time discussing sexual harassment allegations that purportedly contributed to Sebastian Ridley-Thomas’ decision to resign from the state assembly in 2017 — a move she said provided Mark Ridley-Thomas with a motive to help his son financially.

The younger Ridley-Thomas cited health reasons when he stepped down and denied the sexual harassment allegations.



‘Nobody … needed to bribe Mark Ridley-Thomas on any of these issues'

Defense attorney Daralyn Durie pointed out that almost all the prosecution witnesses were from USC, and that none were L.A. county government employees, who she argued could have explained that normal processes were followed in the county contracts.

In testimony as defense witnesses Wednesday, County Supervisor Janice Hahn and former Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said Ridley-Thomas did not try to cajole them to support the contracts in question.

Durie said two of Ridley-Thomas’ votes involved support for studies of possible new contracts with USC, not the approval of money. The third vote, she said, was to extend an existing contract for the online mental health clinic that had a spending cap on it.

The other two votes dealt with a probation reentry center near USC and a probation employee training program. Durie repeatedly noted that Ridley-Thomas had supported these types of programs as a “longstanding advocate for probation reform. Nobody would have thought they needed to bribe Mark Ridley-Thomas on any of these issues.”

With regard to USC granting Sebastian Ridley-Thomas a scholarship, Durie said, “You don’t have to like it but it's a thing that happens.” She reminded the jury that Mark Ridley-Thomas “is certainly not on trial for anything his son did.”

Durie said that while the funneling of the $100,000 from Ridley-Thomas’ campaign fund through the university to his son’s nonprofit broke university rules, there was nothing illegal about it, and in any event the elder Ridley-Thomas knew nothing of the transaction.

She raised questions about the credibility of one of the lead FBI agents who investigated the case, arguing he had made up his mind about Ridley-Thomas early on in his inquiry.

The agent “made up his mind there was a crime before he gathered all of the information,” Durie said. “It's important not to jump to conclusions.”

“I ask you to return [Ridley-Thomas] to his work and to his family,” she said.

The City Council suspended Ridley-Thomas last October in response to his indictment.

McCarthy had little to say about the meeting to reporters, telling them only that ""she requested the meeting.""

Upon entering Capitol, Witthoeft told reporters she had questions for McCarthy and was ""expecting good things"" to come from her meeting with him.

But she also said she's not expecting McCarthy to join her and other House GOP members for a tour of the D.C. jail Friday, where some Jan. 6 defendants are being held in pretrial detention. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican of Georgia, is heading up the visit and will be joined by at least one or two Democrats.

Witthoeft has been leading nightly Jan. 6 protests outside the D.C. jail since Aug. 1. Organizer Nicole Reffitt estimates 5,000-8,000 people live stream the feed of the protest. The protests have drawn fierce and vocal counterdemonstrations and a substantial police presence of about 12-20 officers.

Earlier this month, Witthoeft met with a senior staff aide to the speaker and with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer.

The U.S. Capitol Police conducted an internal investigation and determined in August 2021 that the officer who had fatally shot Babbitt during the Jan. 6 riot acted lawfully and within the department's policy, and the USCP concluded the officer ""potentially saved members and staff from serious injury and possible death"" as a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol and forced their way to the House chamber.

That would suggest a decision on possible charges against Trump is unlikely before next week.

The 23 New Yorkers have been meeting up to three times a week — on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays — for more than two months in the Trump matter, but last convened to hear evidence in that case on Monday. On Wednesday, they were told not to come in, according to two sources, who did not say why that session was canceled.

Grand juries in New York are often asked to consider evidence in multiple cases.

The grand jury has been investigating whether Trump falsified business records when he allegedly directed his then-lawyer and ""fixer"" Michael Cohen to pay ""hush money"" to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.

It is not yet clear whether the grand jury members have any more witnesses they want to hear from, and when or if they will vote on indicting the former president, which would precede any arrest.

Trump set off a firestorm last weekend when he posted on social media that he expected to be arrested Tuesday. House Republicans have accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of abusing his prosecutorial discretion in potentially indicting Trump and have called on Bragg to answer questions before Congress and turn over documents related to the investigation.

The Manhattan D.A.'s office fired back on Thursday with a letter to the chairs of the Republican committees, saying their request for information ""only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene. Neither fact is a legitimate basis for congressional inquiry."" The office's general counsel, Leslie Dubeck, went on to accuse the House Republicans of interfering in and trying to impede state law enforcement."
2023-03-22,2023-03-22 11:03:20,Prescription for housing? California wants Medicaid to cover 6 months of rent,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230322/Prescription-for-housing-California-wants-Medicaid-to-cover-6-months-of-rent.aspx,Health,"Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose administration is struggling to contain a worsening homelessness crisis despite record spending, is trying something bold: tapping federal health care funding to cover rent for homeless people and those at risk of losing their housing.

States are barred from using federal Medicaid dollars to pay directly for rent, but California's governor is asking the administration of President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, to authorize a new program called ""transitional rent,"" which would provide up to six months of rent or temporary housing for low-income enrollees who rely on the state's health care safety net — a new initiative in his arsenal of programs to fight and prevent homelessness.

""I've been talking to the president. We cannot do this alone,"" Newsom told KHN.

The governor is pushing California's version of Medicaid, called Medi-Cal, to fund experimental housing subsidies for homeless people, betting that it's cheaper for taxpayers to cover rent than to allow people to fall into crisis or costly institutional care in hospitals, nursing homes, and jails. Early in his tenure, Newsom proclaimed that ""doctors should be able to write prescriptions for housing the same way they do for insulin or antibiotics.""

But it's a risky endeavor in a high-cost state where median rent is nearly $3,000 a month, and even higher in coastal regions, where most of California's homeless people reside. Experts expect the Biden administration to scrutinize the plan to use health care money to pay rent; and also question its potential effectiveness in light of the state's housing crisis.

""Part of the question is whether this is really Medicaid's job,"" said Vikki Wachino, who served as national Medicaid director in the Obama administration. ""But there is a recognition that social factors like inadequate housing are driving health outcomes, and I think the federal government is open to developing approaches to try and address that.""

Bruce Alexander, a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, declined to say whether the federal government would approve California's request. Yet, Biden's Medicaid officials have approved similar experimental programs in Oregon and Arizona, and California is modeling its program after them.

California is home to an estimated 30% of the homeless people in the U.S., despite representing just 12% of the country's overall population. And Newsom has acknowledged that the numbers are likely far greater than official homeless tallies show. Top health officials say that, to contain soaring safety-net spending and help homeless people get healthy, Medi-Cal has no choice but to combine social services with housing.

Statewide, 5% of Medi-Cal patients account for a staggering 44% of the program's spending, according to state data. And many of the costliest patients lack stable housing: Nearly half of patients experiencing homelessness visited the emergency room four times or more in 2019 and were more likely than other low-income adults to be admitted to the hospital, and a large majority of visits were covered by Medi-Cal, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

""What we have today doesn't work,"" said Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, explaining his argument that housing is a critical component of health care. ""Why do we have to wait so long for people to be so sick?""

The federal government has already approved a massive social experiment in California, known as CalAIM, which is transforming Medi-Cal. Over five years, the initiative is expected to pour $12 billion into new Medi-Cal services delivered outside of traditional health care. In communities across the state, it is already funding services for some low-income patients, including paying rental security deposits for homeless people and those facing eviction; delivering prepared healthy meals for people with diabetes; and helping formerly incarcerated people find jobs.

The transitional rent program would add another service to those already available, though only a sliver of the 15.4 million Medi-Cal enrollees actually receive those new and expensive social services.

Rent payments could begin as soon as 2025 and cost roughly $117 million per year once fully implemented. And while state officials say anyone who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless would be eligible, not everyone who qualifies will receive new services due to capacity limits. Among those who stand to benefit are nearly 11,000 people already enrolled in Medi-Cal housing services.

""The ongoing conversation is how do we convince the federal government that housing is a health care issue,"" said Mari Cantwell, who served as Medi-Cal director from 2015 to 2020. ""You have to convince them that you're going to save money because you're not going to have as many people showing up at the emergency room and in long-term hospitalizations.""

Health care experiments in California and around the country that funded housing supports have demonstrated early success in reducing costs and making people healthier. But while some programs paid for housing security deposits or participants' first month of rent, none directly covered rent for an extended period.

""Without that foundational support, we are playing in the margins,"" Newsom said.

State health officials argue that paying for six months of rent will be even more successful at reducing health care costs and improving enrollees' health, but experts say that, to work, the initiative must have strict accountability and be bundled with an array of social services.

In a precursor to the state's current initiative, California experimented with a mix of housing assistance programs and social services through its ""Whole Person Care"" pilot program. Nadereh Pourat, of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, evaluated the program for the state concluding that local trials reduced emergency visits and hospitalizations, saving an average of $383 per Medi-Cal beneficiary per year — a meager amount compared with the program's cost.

Over five years, the state spent $3.6 billion serving about 250,000 patients enrolled in local experiments, Pourat said.

And a randomized control trial in Santa Clara County that provided supportive housing for homeless people showed reductions in psychiatric emergency room visits and improvements in care. ""Lives stabilized and we saw a huge uptick in substance use care and mental health care, the things that everybody wants people to use to get healthier,"" said Dr. Margot Kushel, director of the University of California-San Francisco's Center for Vulnerable Populations at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, who worked on the study.

But insurers implementing the broader Medi-Cal initiative say they are skeptical that spending health care money on housing will save the system money. And health care experts say that, while six months of rent can be a bridge while people wait for permanent housing, there's a bigger obstacle: California's affordable housing shortage.

""We can design incredible Medicaid policies to alleviate homelessness and pay for all the necessary supportive services, but without the adequate housing, frankly, it's not going to work,"" Kushel said.

Newsom acknowledges that criticism. ""The crisis of homelessness will never be solved without first solving the crisis of housing,"" he said last week, arguing California should plow more money into housing for homeless people with severe mental health conditions or addiction disorders.

He will ask the legislature to put before voters a 2024 ballot initiative that would infuse California's mental health system with at least 6,000 new treatment beds and supportive housing units for people struggling with mental health and addiction disorders, many of whom are homeless. The proposed bond measure would generate from $3 billion to $5 billion for psychiatric housing and treatment villages aimed at serving more than 10,000 additional people a year. The initiative also would ask voters to set aside at least $1 billion a year for supportive housing from an existing tax on California millionaires that funds local mental health programs.

""People who are struggling with these issues, especially those who are on the streets or in other vulnerable conditions, will have more resources to get the help they need,"" Newsom said.

For transitional rent, six months of payments would be available for select high-need residents enrolled in Medi-Cal, particularly those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless — and those transitioning from more costly institutions such as mental health crisis centers, jails and prisons, and foster care. Medi-Cal patients at risk of inpatient hospitalization or who frequent the emergency room would also be eligible.

""It's a pretty big challenge; I'm not going to lie,"" said Jacey Cooper, the Medi-Cal director. ""But we know that people experiencing homelessness cycle in and out of emergency rooms, so we have a real role to play in both preventing and ending homelessness.""

Public health experts say the problem will continue to explode without creative thinking about how to fund housing in health care, but they warn the state must be wary of potential abuses of the program.

""It has to be designed carefully because, unfortunately, there are always people looking to game the system,"" said Dr. Tony Iton, a public health expert who is now a senior vice president at the California Endowment. ""Decisions must be made by clinicians — not housing organizations just looking for another source of revenue.""

For Stephen Morton, who lives in the Orange County community of Laguna Woods, the journey from homelessness into permanent housing illustrates the amount of public spending it can take for the effort to pay off.

Morton, 60, bounced between shelters and his car for nearly two years and racked up extraordinary Medi-Cal costs due to prolonged hospitalizations and repeated emergency room trips to treat chronic heart disease, asthma, and diabetes.

Medi-Cal covered Morton's open-heart surgery and hospital stays, which lasted weeks. He landed temporary housing through a state-sponsored program called Project Roomkey before getting permanent housing through a federal low-income housing voucher — an ongoing benefit that covers all but $50 of his rent.

Since getting his apartment, Morton said, he's been able to stop taking one diabetes medication and lose weight. He attributes improvements in his blood sugar levels to his housing and the healthy, home-delivered meals he receives via Medi-Cal.

""It's usually scrambled eggs for breakfast and the fish menu for dinner. I'm shocked it's so good,"" Morton said. ""Now I have a microwave and I'm indoors. I'm so grateful and so much healthier.""

2023-03-22,2023-03-22 10:58:34,End of covid emergency will usher in changes across the US health system,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230322/End-of-covid-emergency-will-usher-in-changes-across-the-US-health-system.aspx,Health,"The Biden administration's decision to end the covid-19 public health emergency in May will institute sweeping changes across the health care system that go far beyond many people having to pay more for covid tests.

In response to the pandemic, the federal government in 2020 suspended many of its rules on how care is delivered. That transformed essentially every corner of American health care — from hospitals and nursing homes to public health and treatment for people recovering from addiction.

Now, as the government prepares to reverse some of those steps, here's a glimpse at ways patients will be affected:

Training rules for nursing home staff get stricter

The end of the emergency means nursing homes will have to meet higher standards for training workers.

Advocates for nursing home residents are eager to see the old, tougher training requirements reinstated, but the industry says that move could worsen staffing shortages plaguing facilities nationwide.

In the early days of the pandemic, to help nursing homes function under the virus's onslaught, the federal government relaxed training requirements. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services instituted a national policy saying nursing homes needn't follow regulations requiring nurse aides to undergo at least 75 hours of state-approved training. Normally, a nursing home couldn't employ aides for more than four months unless they met those requirements.

Last year, CMS decided the relaxed training rules would no longer apply nationwide, but states and facilities could ask for permission to be held to the lower standards. As of March, 17 states had such exemptions, according to CMS — Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington — as did 356 individual nursing homes in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington, D.C.

Nurse aides often provide the most direct and labor-intensive care for residents, including bathing and other hygiene-related tasks, feeding, monitoring vital signs, and keeping rooms clean. Research has shown that nursing homes with staffing instability maintain a lower quality of care.

Advocates for nursing home residents are pleased the training exceptions will end but fear that the quality of care could nevertheless deteriorate. That's because CMS has signaled that, after the looser standards expire, some of the hours that nurse aides logged during the pandemic could count toward their 75 hours of required training. On-the-job experience, however, is not necessarily a sound substitute for the training workers missed, advocates argue.

Adequate training of aides is crucial so ""they know what they're doing before they provide care, for their own good as well as for the residents,"" said Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy.

The American Health Care Association, the largest nursing home lobbying group, released a December survey finding that roughly 4 in 5 facilities were dealing with moderate to high levels of staff shortages.

Treatment threatened for people recovering from addiction

A looming rollback of broader access to buprenorphine, an important medication for people in recovery from opioid addiction, is alarming patients and doctors.

During the public health emergency, the Drug Enforcement Administration said providers could prescribe certain controlled substances virtually or over the phone without first conducting an in-person medical evaluation. One of those drugs, buprenorphine, is an opioid that can prevent debilitating withdrawal symptoms for people trying to recover from addiction to other opioids. Research has shown using it more than halves the risk of overdose.

Amid a national epidemic of opioid addiction, if the expanded policy for buprenorphine ends, ""thousands of people are going to die,"" said Ryan Hampton, an activist who is in recovery.

The DEA in late February proposed regulations that would partly roll back the prescribing of controlled substances through telemedicine. A clinician could use telemedicine to order an initial 30-day supply of medications such as buprenorphine, Ambien, Valium, and Xanax, but patients would need an in-person evaluation to get a refill.

For another group of drugs, including Adderall, Ritalin, and oxycodone, the DEA proposal would institute tighter controls. Patients seeking those medications would need to see a doctor in person for an initial prescription.

David Herzberg, a historian of drugs at the University at Buffalo, said the DEA's approach reflects a fundamental challenge in developing drug policy: meeting the needs of people who rely on a drug that can be abused without making that drug too readily available to others.

The DEA, he added, is ""clearly seriously wrestling with this problem.""

Hospitals return to normal, somewhat

During the pandemic, CMS has tried to limit problems that could arise if there weren't enough health care workers to treat patients — especially before there were covid vaccines when workers were at greater risk of getting sick.

For example, CMS allowed hospitals to make broader use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants when caring for Medicare patients. And new physicians not yet credentialed to work at a particular hospital — for example, because governing bodies lacked time to conduct their reviews — could nonetheless practice there.

Other changes during the public health emergency were meant to shore up hospital capacity. Critical access hospitals, small hospitals located in rural areas, didn't have to comply with federal rules for Medicare stating they were limited to 25 inpatient beds and patients' stays could not exceed 96 hours, on average.

Once the emergency ends, those exceptions will disappear.

Hospitals are trying to persuade federal officials to maintain multiple covid-era policies beyond the emergency or work with Congress to change the law.

Surveillance of infectious diseases splinters

The way state and local public health departments monitor the spread of disease will change after the emergency ends, because the Department of Health and Human Services won't be able to require labs to report covid testing data.

Without a uniform, federal requirement, how states and counties track the spread of the coronavirus will vary. In addition, though hospitals will still provide covid data to the federal government, they may do so less frequently.

Public health departments are still getting their arms around the scope of the changes, said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

In some ways, the end of the emergency provides public health officials an opportunity to rethink covid surveillance. Compared with the pandemic's early days, when at-home tests were unavailable and people relied heavily on labs to determine whether they were infected, testing data from labs now reveals less about how the virus is spreading.

Public health officials don't think ""getting all test results from all lab tests is potentially the right strategy anymore,"" Hamilton said. Flu surveillance provides a potential alternative model: For influenza, public health departments seek test results from a sampling of labs.

""We're still trying to work out what's the best, consistent strategy. And I don't think we have that yet,"" Hamilton said."
2023-03-22,2023-03-22 10:53:00,"A lot of thought, little action: Proposals about mental health go unheeded",https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230322/A-lot-of-thought-little-action-Proposals-about-mental-health-go-unheeded.aspx,Health,"Thousands of people struggle to access mental health services in Florida. The treatment system is disjointed and complex. Some residents bounce between providers and are prescribed different medications with clinicians unaware of what happened. Jails and prisons have become de facto homes for many who need care.

These problems and more were identified in a scathing report released earlier this year by the Commission on Mental Health and Substance Abuse, a 19-person panel that Florida lawmakers created in 2021 to push for reforms of the state’s patchwork of behavioral health services for uninsured people and low-income families.

What’s most troubling about the group’s findings? They aren’t new.

More than 20 years ago, the Florida Legislature set up a commission with the same name to examine the same issues and publish recommendations on how to improve mental health care in the publicly funded system.

The echoes between the two groups — over two decades apart — are unmistakable. And Florida isn’t the only state struggling with the criminalization of mental illness, a lack of coordination between providers, and insufficient access to treatment.

Last year, the national advocacy group Mental Health America said Florida ranked 46th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia for access to such care. Arizona, Kansas, Georgia, Alabama, and Texas were worse off, according to the nonprofit, which based its rankings on access to insurance, treatment, and special education, along with the cost and quality of insurance and the number of mental health providers.

Conversations about mental health are at the forefront nationwide amid the proliferation of mass shootings, pandemic-related stress, rising suicide rates, and shifting viewpoints on the role of police in handling 911 calls.

“It comes down to how much investment, financially, legislators are willing to put into building a system that works,” said Caren Howard, director of policy and advocacy at Mental Health America, a nonprofit just outside Washington, D.C.

In Florida, the 1999 Commission on Mental Health and Substance Abuse was launched when Jeb Bush was governor. In a 74-page report released in 2001, the group called the state’s treatment system “complex, fragmented, uncoordinated and often ineffective.”

The commission found that jails and prisons were Florida’s “largest mental hospitals” after “deinstitutionalization” began — the 20th-century movement to shutter state psychiatric facilities and treat people instead through community services.

The report also blasted Florida agencies for not sharing patient data with one another and being unable to track whether those with severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia were truly getting needed help.

“A lot of the things that we’re finding now, they found back then,” said Charlotte County Sheriff Bill Prummell, a member of the latest commission who served as the chairperson for about 18 months.

The similarities raise questions for the group about whether its work will also end up on a shelf, collecting dust, as Florida lawmakers continue to wrestle with the same challenges again and again.

“Are they really going to take us seriously?” Prummell asked.

Dropping the ball

After hosting public meetings across Florida, the 1999 commission urged a slate of reforms, including expanding jail diversion programs like mental health courts.

But the group’s key recommendation was to set up a “coordinating council” in the governor’s office to lead the system and develop a strategy for care.

That never happened.

David Shern, chairperson of the 1999 group and former dean of the University of South Florida’s Louis de la Parte Florida Mental Health Institute, said he thinks Bush’s office dropped the ball.

The Republican governor, known for his spending cuts, didn’t want to add staff to his office, so the coordinating council was never created, said Shern.

That’s “where the plan really fell apart,” he said.

Instead, lawmakers established a work group in the Department of Children and Families to review how Florida could improve its behavioral health system and submit a report to Bush, among other leaders.

The work group disbanded in 2003. That same year, the legislature created a not-for-profit corporation to oversee the system, but it was dissolved in 2011, according to state business records. When the Tampa Bay Times recently asked for the work group’s report, Laura Walthall, a spokesperson for the Department of Children and Families, said it couldn’t be found. Bush didn’t respond to emailed questions.

Former state Rep. Sandra Murman, however, said that what happened is just a reality of bureaucracy.

“It’s the same with all commissions,” said Murman, a Tampa Republican who was part of the 1999 group. “The life cycle of any big report that comes out is probably about five years.”

Lawmakers leave Tallahassee because of term limits. Agency heads step down. New officials get elected. Priorities shift.

“They come in with their agenda, and you won’t see social services ever at the top,” she said of Florida legislative leaders.

But some state lawmakers focused on mental illness in the wake of the 2018 shooting that left 17 students and staff members dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Amid mounting public demand for more drastic gun control measures, such as an assault weapons ban, the Republican-controlled legislature instead approved more limited restrictions, like Florida’s “red flag” law, along with steps unrelated to gun control, allocating about $400 million for mental health and school safety initiatives.

Before the massacre, Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz received mental health services through several public and private providers, splitting the future gunman’s medical history, according to a 2019 report from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission.

“No single health professional or entity had the entire ‘story’ regarding Cruz’s mental health and family issues, due, in part, to an absence of communication between providers and a lack of disclosure by the Cruz family,” the report said.

The vast majority of people with a mental illness are not violent, according to the nonprofit National Council for Mental Wellbeing in Washington, D.C. And they are more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators.

In 2020, a grand jury investigating school safety issues related to the shooting called Florida’s mental health care system “a mess.”

“Deficiencies in funding, leadership and services,” the grand jury said, “tend to turn up everywhere like bad pennies.”

The panel said it didn’t have enough time to conduct a full review of the system and urged state lawmakers to set up a commission to do so.

The latest commission reported that the system remains splintered and suffers from “enormous gaps in treatment.” And there’s still no centralized database on patients.

The group, just like its predecessor over two decades ago, has suggested that Florida create more jail diversion programs and that state agencies share patient data. The commission has pitched new ideas, too, like a pilot program in which one agency manages all public behavioral health funding in a geographic area, including state money and local dollars, so providers can focus more on care and less on complicated billing processes.

“This isn’t going away, and if we don’t address it, it’s going to get worse,” Prummell told a House subcommittee last month.

Solutions to Florida’s problems are not headline grabbers, which makes it tough to generate political support, said Holly Bullard, chief strategy and development officer at the Florida Policy Institute, an Orlando nonprofit.

“Building good government, it can get technical,” she said, “and sometimes it’s hard to communicate the importance of it.”

Will anything change?

There’s been some progress in Florida’s mental health care system since 2001, said Jay Reeve, the new chairperson of the latest commission and CEO of Apalachee Center, a behavioral health provider in Tallahassee.

The system is more responsive to regional issues, partly because of state contracts with seven “managing entities” — nonprofits that oversee safety-net services for the uninsured, he said.

There’s also been an increase in initiatives like mobile response teams, which help people in mental health emergencies, and crisis intervention training for police officers, in which they get trained on de-escalation techniques and psychiatric diagnoses so they know when to get residents into treatment instead of arresting them, Reeve said.

The Department of Children and Families used to spend about $500 million a year on community-based behavioral health services such as outpatient treatment, case management, and crisis stabilization units, the 1999 commission reported. Now, its budget for such care is $1.1 billion.

Pockets of innovation exist at the local level, too, as in Palm Beach County, where an initiative called BeWellPBC aims to boost the area’s mental health care workforce, among other things, said Shern, senior associate in the department of mental health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

But challenges remain.

Nearly 3 million Florida adults have a mental illness, according to Mental Health America. That’s about 17% of the state’s population of those 18 and up. An estimated 225,000 youths experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, the nonprofit reported in October.

In 2020, Florida ranked last among states for per capita mental health care funding, the Parkland grand jury said. In 2021, the Miami-Dade County jail system was the largest psychiatric institution in the state, according to the 11th Judicial Circuit.

“As long as you keep things siloed, accountability is easier to dodge,” said Ann Berner, a member of the 2021 commission and CEO of Southeast Florida Behavioral Health Network, a managing entity.

Political will is needed to enact major reforms, Shern said. So is follow-up on the commission’s work, said Murman, who works at Shumaker Advisors Florida, a lobbying firm.

“In this case, it probably is something that has to be revived every five years to really make an impact,” she said.

Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, a Parkland Democrat on the 2021 commission, said there’s bipartisan support to improve the system.

But during the current legislative session, the Tampa Bay Times on March 13 could find only one House bill and a matching Senate bill based on the commission’s 35-page interim report: a proposal to study Medicaid expansion for some young adults age 26 and under. (Republican leaders in Florida have refused to expand the federal-state health care program under the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010.)

Hunschofsky said she thinks the legislature will take more action once the commission releases its final report, which is due by Sept. 1.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office referred questions to the Department of Children and Families, where officials didn’t answer them.

Senate President Kathleen Passidomo didn’t respond to a voicemail and interview requests made through a spokesperson. Nor could House Speaker Paul Renner be reached for comment.

After more than 20 years, Shern is frustrated.

“It’s time to move on these issues,” he said. “We’ve spent literally decades thinking about them, talking about them.”

The promotional price for customers is $1,350 USD per whole genome when using NovaSeq X Plus and a 25B flow cell, which will be commercially available later this year.

""Many long-read solutions have been stunted by high DNA input requirements, complex workflows with low throughput, and highly variable results on dedicated long-read instruments. Illumina Complete Long Reads overcomes those pain points and associated costs to make long-read sequencing accessible and streamlined for genomic labs."" Alex Aravanis, chief technology officer and head of research and product development at Illumina

Early customer data reinforces accuracy and flexibility

At the Illumina Genomics Forum in September 2022, Aravanis presented preliminary Illumina Complete Long Read performance data against the benchmarking data sets from the PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge v2. Illumina Complete Long Reads with DRAGEN analysis generated an F1 score—a compound statistic of precision and recall—of 99.87%.

Last month at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT) conference, early-access customers shared data reinforcing Illumina Complete Long Reads' high accuracy and flexible DNA input, as well as the capabilities that help to reduce cost and operational complexity.

Michael Quail, PhD, principal scientific manager, Sequencing R&D at Wellcome Sanger Institute, said, ""The library prep was straightforward, with flexible input requirements. We are impressed with the accuracy of the data, along with the read lengths and phase blocks that can be generated on Illumina sequencers.""

Illumina plans to use this technology as a platform for long-read application development. In the second half of 2023, Illumina will launch an enrichment assay, an even more affordable, higher throughput, targeted solution focused on regions known to benefit from additional insight with longer reads. Illumina will explore additional applications beyond WGS and nonhuman samples in the future.

The study finds that eGDR, a proxy marker of insulin resistance, can serve as a marker to identify at-risk type 1 diabetes patients.

Study: Estimated glucose disposal rate is associated with retinopathy and kidney disease in young people with type 1 diabetes: a nationwide observational study. Image Credit: sciencepics / Shutterstock

Background

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic health condition characterized by increased blood glucose levels due to a lack of pancreatic insulin production. The condition increases the risk of cardiovascular complications even in individuals with good glycemic control. Apart from hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, and hypertension increase the risk of cardiovascular complications in type 1 diabetes patients.

Insulin resistance is a major cause of hyperglycemia in diabetes patients. It occurs when cells in the body become unresponsive to insulin produced by pancreatic beta-cells. It is well-documented that in type 1 diabetes patients, insulin resistance is associated with macrovascular complications, including coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias and sudden death, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease.

In the current study, scientists have determined the relationship between insulin resistance and microvascular complications (diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy) in young adults with type 1 diabetes.

Study design

The study analyzed the data obtained from the Swedish pediatric registry for diabetes (SweDiabKids) and the registry for adults (NDR). All individuals who have type 1 diabetes for a duration of less than 10 years were included in the analysis.

Based on the eGDR values, the individuals were divided into four categories (eGDR value: < 4, 4 to 5.99, 6 to 7.99, and ≥ 8 mg/kg/min). Within these categories, the incidence rate and the risk of retinopathy and kidney disease were determined.

The participants were followed from the date of registry (index date) until the detection of retinopathy or kidney disease or until the end of the study period (December 2017). The study was conducted between 1998 and 2017. In both retinopathy and kidney disease groups, the average age of participants at the index date was 21 years.

Various confounding factors were addressed in the analysis, including age, sex, eGDR estimates, lipid profile, glycemic index, body mass index (BMI), physical activity level, hypertension, and medications.

Estimated crude cumulative risk curves illustrated the accumulated estimated risk of retinopathy (A) and kidney disease (B) based on these observed time intervals in young people with type 1 diabetes (eGDR = estimated glucose disposal rate). The shaded are represents the 95% confidence interval of the estimated crude curves

Association between eGDR and retinopathy

The retinopathy group was followed up for an average of 4.8 years. The analysis conducted after adjustment for all confounding factors revealed that a lower eGDR estimate is associated with an increased risk of retinopathy.

Considering kidney disease as a confounding factor, no competing risk between retinopathy and kidney disease was observed.

Association between eGDR and kidney disease

The kidney disease group was followed up for an average of 5.4 years. The analysis conducted after adjustment for all confounding factors revealed that a lower eGDR estimate is associated with an increased risk of kidney disease. However, the same risk was not observed among the participants with the lowest eGDR (< 4 mg/kg/min).

Considering retinopathy as a confounding factor, no competing risk between retinopathy and kidney disease was observed.

In both retinopathy and kidney disease groups, the glycemic control estimate (HbA1c) was identified as the highest risk factor, followed by BMI and hypertension.

Study significance

The study indicates that a lower eGDR increases the risk of retinopathy and kidney disease in young adults with type 1 diabetes. A low eGDR is indicative of high insulin resistance.

As mentioned by the scientists, early detection of microvascular complications via eGDR estimation can reduce the risk of subsequent macrovascular complications and organ damage. In other words, eGDR can be used as a useful marker for identifying at-risk individuals with type 1 diabetes.

This is a large-scale nationwide, observational study with a long follow-up period. The scientists consider this as the major strength of the study. However, they mention that the eGDR formula used in the study has not been fully validated in the youth. Thus, they are unsure how accurately eGDR estimates reflect insulin resistance.

They highlight the need for future studies to more conclusively determine the impact of insulin resistance on micro- and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes patients."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have effectively reduced morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the continual emergence of increasingly transmissible and immune-evasive VOCs has threatened vaccine efficacy. Therefore, updated multivalent vaccines conferring durable and broad immune protection are required to mitigate COVID-19.

Protein subunit-type COVID-19 vaccines are reportedly safe and immunogenic, with ease of mass-level production, distribution, storage, and transportation, and have demonstrated success against other viruses, such as the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The properties make the vaccine type ideal candidates for global vaccine equity, especially for nations having limited access to viral vector-based and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines.

The study's authors previously demonstrated the immunogenicity of S1-targeted vaccines against several β-CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV).

About the study

In the present study, researchers evaluate the immunogenicity of a tetravalent SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine, targeting Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma S1, among RMs; infected with SIV.

The team profiled lymphocyte responses to vaccination for two months following initial prime vaccination by determining B and T lymphocyte counts. They investigated T-lymphocyte activation marker levels, and memory lymphocyte subset counts among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Activation markers, such as the cluster of differentiation (CD)- 38, -69, and the human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype (HLA-DR), were used for the analysis.

In addition, Ki-67 proliferation marker expression was assessed. Before vaccination, RMs were infected with SIVs that naturally infect African green monkeys (SIVsab). RMs were administered prime and booster vaccinations on week 3.0 with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma spike proteins, mixed with the AddaVaxTM squalene-based adjuvant. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins expressing vectors were constructed, and the plasmid constructs were confirmed by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing.

Subsequently, the proteins were purified and transiently expressed in Expi293 cells. Transfection experiments were performed, following which the supernatants were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot (WB) analyses. Rhesus macaques peripheral blood mononuclear cells (RM-PMBCs) were obtained on days 1.0, 3.0, 7.0, 10.0, 14.0., 21.0, 24.0, 28.0, 31.0, 35.0, 42.0, 49.0, and 64.0 days after prime vaccination. The serological anti-Wuhan-Hu-1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody endpoint titers (EPT) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

Further, microneutralization assays (NT 90 ) were performed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization ability of vaccinated RM sera. The inhibition of binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and SARS-CoV-2 VOCs' trimeric S proteins, including those of Omicron sub-VOCs (BA.2 sub-VOC, BA.3 sub-VOC, BA.1 sub-VOC with R246K mutation, and the BA.1 sub-VOC with L452R mutation), was assessed.

The team performed intracellular cytokine staining to assess anti-S T lymphocyte responses among hyper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Additionally, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) cytokines were assessed. Flow cytometry was performed to determine the serological immunological cell counts in absolute terms.

Results

The tetravalent vaccine approach induced cellular and humoral immunological responses, with B- and T-lymphocyte responses peaking mainly after booster vaccinations. In addition, the tetravalent vaccine induced elicited cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 – blocking antibodies (ACE2-blocking antibodies), and cell-mediated responses, including S-targeted CD4+ T (helper T) lymphocytes.

The tetravalent vaccine could induce ACE2 blocking and Omicron S binding antibodies without vaccinating with Omicron, indicating broad immune protection against the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The vaccine also elicited antibodies against the wild-type (WT), Beta, and Delta variants. Ant-S CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses were observed in RM PBMCs, with variable cytokine levels, after 42.0 days of prime vaccination. Albeit, no CD8+ T (cytotoxic T) lymphocyte responses were observed. CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were most elevated following booster vaccination. Elevated CD38, CD69, Ki-67, and HLA-DR expression were observed among T lymphocyte subsets.

Decreased abundance of helper and central cytotoxic memory (CM) T lymphocytes, helper T, and cytotoxic T-naive T lymphocytes were observed following prime vaccination and booster vaccination.

On the contrary, helper and cytotoxic effector memory (EM) T lymphocyte abundance increased following prime-boost vaccination. The findings indicated that the vaccine candidate shifted toward an EM phenotype from a CM phenotype, which might aid in developing robust and rapid vaccination responses.

Conclusion

The study findings showed that the tetravalent vaccine approach conferred broad immune protection against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings could inform vaccine development to reduce the global health burden of COVID-19.

There is a need for more accurate knowledge of variable parameters, such as vaccination modalities that leave an imprint on the immune memory of individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.

Researchers need these insights because despite large-scale COVID-19 vaccine coverage, people, especially in Western countries, are still experiencing SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, the belief that hybrid immunity confers superior protection against the virus requires experimental validation.

Naturally, SARS-CoV-2 S-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) levels decline (or wane) in the blood serum, especially six months after vaccination or infection, which correlates with an increased risk of reinfection. In addition, vaccine-elicited nAbs poorly neutralize new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), like Omicron.

Most importantly, besides serum Abs, immune memory has a cellular component comprised of memory T and B lymphocytes, which actively launch a rapid, augmented immune response if the immunological memory barrier fails to prevent reinfection.

About the study

In the present study, researchers performed a longitudinal analysis on 613 individuals and broadly categorized the groups as follows:

individuals who recovered from severe or mild COVID-19,

people who were infected but received two or one dose of Pfizer (BNT162b2) or AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1) vaccine, respectively, and

people never infected by SARS-CoV-2 but fully vaccinated

The researchers monitored their clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 S- or receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific humoral and cellular immunity six months after infection or vaccination. They used multiparameter flow cytometry (FC) for analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific memory B cells (mBC) compartment.

Further, the team collected a blood sample between vaccination and the six months follow-up period to estimate the varying infection rate among convalescent vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinated individuals.

In addition, they monitored the occurrence of breakthrough infections in all study groups using the bioMerieux Vidas assay that measured RBD IgG titers against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen. The rebound of RBD-specific nAb titers indicated breakthrough infection, not their steady decline.

Results

The first and foremost study finding was that the concentrations of serum RBD-specific IgGs were the highest among convalescent vaccinated patients, regardless of the vaccination regimen, as these individuals had hybrid immunity.

Using a West Nile virus murine infection model, researchers demonstrated that mBCs recognize variants of the original pathogen more efficiently than the Abs produced by long-lived plasma cells (PCs).

Kotaki et al. proved this in humans in the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated people. They showed that the mBCs pool preserved broadly reactive Abs specificities that recognized the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants but not their sera.

The current study data also showed that mBCs were less susceptible to quantitative variations than their humoral counterparts but were more subject to qualitative changes dictated by an individual's infection history.

Remarkably, individuals in the hybrid immunity group displayed increased frequencies of immunoglobulin D (IgD)−a cluster of differentiation (CD)27− mucosa-targeted mBC subset called double-negative type 2 (DN2) MBCs. In addition, an enhanced T helper cell 1 (TH1) polarization characterized their S–specific follicular T helper (TFH) cell pool.

The increased abundance of the memory DN2 mBC subset demonstrated how vaccinating previously infected convalescent individuals-initiated changes in the mBC landscape. Together, this data reinforced how the serological component of the mBC pools, its compositional reshaping, and trafficking pattern occurred in individuals with hybrid immunity.

Besides more DN2 mBCs, IgA-switched RBD-specific mBCs profusion was another unique feature of hybrid immunity. IgA is a crucial immune component at mucosal surfaces, including in the upper respiratory tract, where SARS-CoV-2 initiates infection. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered higher frequencies of IgA-switched mBCs than vaccination.

Conclusions

To conclude, the study data favored boosting previously SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Vaccination of such individuals primed their immune system more effectively than the vaccination alone and helped them build superior serological and mBC responses at gut mucosal sites and airways. Another proof of the superiority of hybrid immunity is its correlation with the expansion of the DN2 mBC subtype that displayed a mucosal-limited tropism."

In a recent study posted to the Preprints with The Lancet* server, researchers in China conducted a multi-center, retrospective study to gather data on the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction (OD) after three years of recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

OD, or loss of smell, is among the most common post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), which studies have shown also persists one or two years after disease onset. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the human host from the nasal cavity to establish infection by interacting with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.

Studies have found that people with more ACE2 expression in their olfactory epithelium are prone to infection and developing OD later.

In most cases, this issue gradually fades away. However, in some cases, its long-term persistence affects the life of patients. For instance, some OD patients experience severe shortness of breath. Previous studies have not determined when an individual with persistent OD recovers from this peculiar condition and their clinical characteristics. Assessment of these variables for patients with OD could help counsel and treat them in time.

About the study

In the present study, researchers performed a detailed survey among 167 people, of which 155 had recovered from COVID-19 before April 1, 2020, and the remaining 170 were age-matched healthy controls in Wuhan, China. These patients met the prespecified recovery criteria.

They had normal body temperature for at least three days, no respiratory symptoms, and two sequential reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests confirmed their COVID-19-negative status.

The team collected demographic, epidemiological, and clinical symptoms data face-to-face. However, they resolved the ambiguity in data, if any, over a telephone call. For other evaluations, they relied on the scores of specific tests, e.g., a score of six or more on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Anxiety Scale (HAMA) indicated a patient was depressed and anxious. Likewise, they used Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) to assess sleep disturbances among the study participants.

The researchers used Toyota‐Takagi (T&T) olfactometry scores system for olfactory testing, which used five odors, pineapple, mint, garlic, rose, and ginger, for olfactory sensitivity measurements. In a week, they tested each study participant twice, and the median of the recognition field indicated whether their olfactory function was normal. Finally, the team made statistical comparisons between the study and control groups.

For continuous variables, they performed the Mann–Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. A logistic regression model helped them identify all OD-related factors, while, in a multivariable analysis, a p-value cutoff of 0.05 helped them identify significant predictors by forward elimination.

Results

The researchers remarkably followed up COVID-19 recovered patients for 36 months (three years) after infection. They made three significant findings. First, they found that >95% of patients restored normal olfactory function by the third year after COVID-19 recovery, assessed via T&T tests. Second, they found that insomnia increased the risk of persistent hyposmia. Third, patients with anxiety are more likely to experience loss of smell in the long term.

In addition, among patients who recovered from COVID-19 three years ago, 10 to 15% had anxiety and depression, and 30% to 50% had sleeping disorders.

Another remarkable observation was that although only 4.5% of the study participants had persistent OD, none had anosmia or complete loss of smell. Another long-term follow-up study by Boscolo Rizzo et al. reported persistent OD in 11.8% of the study participants during a two-year follow-up.

The observed lower rate of OD in this study confirms that this condition gradually fades away in most cases, though additional factors might also be at play. For instance, the SARS-CoV-2 variant that caused the initial infection might be behind varying OD incidence across different populations.

Of 155 COVID-19-recovered patients constituting the study population, 80.6% were in the 50 to 70 years age group, and it is well-recognized that aging degenerates olfactory sensitivity. However, the results showed no statistically significant association between persistent OD and age, general COVID-19 symptoms, or therapies, except for female dependence.

Thus, the authors noted that while headache and anosmia were correlated, the headache and OD were not. Consistent with previous findings, they also noted that insomnia might be a risk factor for OD in COVID-19 patients, especially those with AIS scores ≥6.

Conclusion

Overall, the study results suggested that though it might take time, up to three years in most cases, COVID-19 patients recover from olfactory dysfunction. Based on observed high OD recovery rates, the researchers reassured patients with SARS-COV-2 infection of a good prognosis.

2023-03-24,2023-03-24 08:51:49,"Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman expected back 'soon,' but no certain timeline yet",https://6abc.com/john-fetterman-pa-politics-senator-clinical-depression/13002567/,Health,"Fetterman's office said that he is expected to return soon to the chamber, although leaders are giving no timeline five weeks after he sought inpatient treatment for clinical depression.

""He'll be back soon, at least over a week, but soon,"" spokesperson Joe Calvello said Thursday.

HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania -- Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman's office said Thursday that he is expected to return soon to the chamber, although Democratic leaders are giving no timeline five weeks after he sought inpatient treatment for clinical depression.

Fetterman, 53, was weeks into his service in Washington and still recovering from the aftereffects of the stroke he had last May during his campaign when he checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Feb. 15.

Aides said at the time that Fetterman had not been his usual self for weeks. He was withdrawn, showing a disinterest in talking, eating and the usual banter with aides. Post-stroke depression is common and treatable, doctors say.

Asked about when Fetterman might return, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said only that Fetterman is recuperating.

""We want to give him the space to recuperate,"" Schumer said at a Wednesday news conference. ""He needs it, it's fair, it's right. There are other people in the Senate who have taken their time to recuperate but I'm confident he's going to come back and be an outstanding and fine senator.""

A spokesperson said Fetterman is getting better and that the recovery is going well.

""He'll be back soon, at least over a week, but soon,"" spokesperson Joe Calvello said Thursday.

Fetterman is receiving daily in-person briefings by chief of staff Adam Jentleson, Calvello said. The senator is reading the news and getting briefings, he said, while issuing statements through his office and sponsoring legislation. Aides are opening new regional offices in Pennsylvania.

After Fetterman checked in to Walter Reed, his office said he had experienced depression ""off and on throughout his life,"" but it had only become severe in recent weeks. The Capitol physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, recommended Fetterman's hospitalization after conducting an evaluation, his office said then.

In the meantime, Fetterman's aides and his wife, Gisele, have released photos of the senator smiling, being briefed or visiting with her and their three school-age children.

Fetterman had the stroke last May as he was campaigning in a three-way Democratic primary race. The stroke nearly killed him, he has said, and he had surgery to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy.

He won the primary while in the hospital and went on to beat GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz in November, winning the campaign cycle's most expensive race. Fetterman's victory boosted Democrats to a 51-49 majority.

Fetterman was sworn in Jan. 3.

One of Fetterman's main aftereffects from the stroke is auditory processing disorder, which can render someone unable to speak fluidly and quickly process spoken conversation into meaning. Fetterman uses devices in conversations, meetings and congressional hearings that transcribe spoken words in real time.

Post-stroke depression is also a common aftereffect, with 1 in 3 stroke patients experiencing it, and is treatable through antidepressant medication and counseling, doctors say.

Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said in an interview that he has purposely not called Fetterman to talk - ""the last thing he needs is a lot of phone calls,"" Casey said - and does not know when Fetterman will return.

Casey said his sense from Fetterman's staff is that Fetterman has made ""good progress.""

""I'm just happy he's getting the time that he needs and most people understand that these things don't occur over two or three weeks, it takes a little longer,"" Casey said."
2023-03-24,2023-03-24 02:41:48,CDC report finds more children in U.S. diagnosed with autism due to better screening,https://abc13.com/autism-diagnosis-cdc-developmental-disabilities-childhood/12999180/,Health,"In 2020, about 1 in 36 children had been diagnosed with autism by age 8, the CDC says. That's up from 1 in 150 children in 2000.

The rate of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has been growing steadily since 2000, but two new reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight disparities in the types of children identified to have autism spectrum disorder and setbacks in early detection.

In 2020, about 1 in 36 children had been diagnosed with autism by age 8, according to the CDC -- about 2.8%. That's up from a prevalence of 1 in 44 children in 2018 and 1 in 150 children in 2000.

But according to the CDC, this long-term trend has ""largely been interpreted as improvements in more equitable identification of (autism spectrum disorder), particularly for children in groups that have less access or face greater barriers in obtaining services.""

For the first time, diagnosis was more common among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it was among White children. The CDC researchers note that this shift ""may reflect improved screening, awareness, and access to services among historically underserved groups."" In fact, between 2018 and 2020, autism prevalence rose more than twice as fast among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it did among White children.

These findings are based on surveillance data from 11 communities that participate in the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. The data are not nationally representative and vary widely by location -- from a prevalence of 1 in 22 children in California to about half as many in Maryland. The CDC says more research is needed to understand this variation, which could be related to differences in the strategies used to identify and diagnose the condition.

Still, some trends have stayed consistent.

Autism prevalence is significantly higher among boys than girls -- in 2020, there was about a four-fold difference. But it was the first year that more than 1% of 8-year-old girls had been diagnosed with autism.

Also, disparities persist in identifying autism in children who also have an intellectual disability. In 2020, more than half of Black children diagnosed with autism also had an intellectual disability, compared with less than a third of White children. According to the researchers, this finding suggests a need to better detect and evaluate developmental concerns beyond cognitive ability.

Generally, children who have intellectual disabilities are more likely to be diagnosed with autism earlier. But early detection is important for all children with autism, as it helps connect them with helpful resources and interventions.

In recent years, good progress had been made in early detection of autism -- an earlier CDC report found that children born in 2014 were 50% more likely to receive an autism diagnosis or special education by age 4 than those born in 2010.

Another new report published by the CDC on Thursday shows that there was evidence of continued improvement in these trends through February 2020, but the trends reversed as the COVID-19 pandemic hit with ""sustained lower levels"" of evaluations and identification of autism across most of the surveillance network.

In first six months of the pandemic, there were 217 fewer evaluations for every 1,000 children at age 4 than there were four years earlier. There were also nearly three fewer identifications for every 10,000 children, according to the CDC report.

""Disruptions due to the pandemic in the timely evaluation of children and delays in connecting children to the services and support they need could have long-lasting effects,"" said Dr. Karen Remley, director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. ""The data in this report can help communities better understand how the pandemic impacted early identification of autism in young children and anticipate future needs as these children get older."""

2023-03-24,2023-03-23 23:35:54,"Minnesota House set to debate and pass ""trans refuge"" legislation",https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-house-set-to-debate-and-pass-trans-refuge-legislation/,Health,"ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Supporters of a bill up for debate Thursday night say it will make Minnesota a ""refuge"" for transgender people.

Democrats pushing the legislation forward say it will protect trans patients and providers of gender-affirming care from legal action in other states where such care is banned or restricted. It's structured similarly to a proposal that passed the House earlier this week that's works as a ""shield law"" for people seeking and providing abortions at a time when laws vary after the fall of Roe v. Wade.

""We have a responsibility to create more space for our community to live their fullest, authentic lives without fear of violence, rejection, abuse or political attack,"" said Rep. Leigh Finke, DFL-St. Paul, the first openly transgender person elected to the Minnesota Legislature.

The legislation prohibits enforcing out-of-state subpoenas, arrest warrants and extradition requests for people from other states who sought treatment that is legal in Minnesota. It also bars enforcement of court orders elsewhere to remove children from their parents' custody for getting gender-affirming care.

The effort comes as 10 states now prohibit gender-affirming care for minors, including Iowa and South Dakota, according to an analysis by the Human Rights Campaign. Some policies are blocked in court.

DFL lawmakers say the bill ensures transgender children and adults have a safe haven in Minnesota when other states are hostile to them. Republicans ahead of the floor debate held a news conference condemning the effort as the Democrats' ""transgender health care sanctuary state"" bill that runs afoul of the constitution and puts children at risk.

Rep. Leigh Finke CBS

They've raised questions and concern about the long-term impact of certain treatments.

""House File 146 undermines parental rights and most concerningly has zero guardrails to protect our kids,"" said Rep. Peggy Scott, R-Andover.

Many medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, support youth access to care, which doctors say means something different to each patient and family.

Dr. Angela Kade Goepferd with Children's Minnesota said that gender-affirming care that involves surgical procedures is ""incredibly rare"" for minors under 18 and physicians at Children's Minnesota do not perform such surgeries

""The vast majority of gender-affirming care is medication based or supportive services for families,"" she said.

Gov. Tim Walz recently signed an executive order designed to protect gender-affirming care.

Finke said that action recognizes the ""urgency"" around threats to trans people, but the making it law makes protections stronger.

""It's just absolutely crucial that we keep doing this work to build these protections and not worry about what could happen in the future. We need a law behind it,"" she said.

The story is developing and will be updated."
2023-03-24,2023-03-23 18:50:00,"Yes, there was just a tornado near Los Angeles. Is climate change to blame?",https://www.vox.com/science/2023/3/23/23653712/los-angeles-tornado-montebello-california,Science,"In a rare turn of events, a town southeast of Los Angeles was hit by a tornado on Wednesday, marking the latest extreme weather the region has fielded in recent months.

Tornadoes aren’t unheard of in California, but they are less common compared to other parts of the country, with fewer than 10 typically observed in the state per year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Wednesday’s tornado — which affected the town of Montebello and damaged 17 buildings — was also especially strong, and is the most severe to affect the region in 40 years, per the National Weather Service.

The tornado followed another weaker tornado, which touched down Tuesday in Carpinteria, a town northwest of Los Angeles, and months of other extreme weather in the state.

As Vox’s Benji Jones reported, California has experienced what’s known as “weather whiplash” throughout this year, as it’s endured days of intense rain and flooding after dealing with a severe drought. That rain was the product of a phenomenon called “atmospheric rivers,” what Jones describes as “narrow corridors of water in the sky,” which appear to be happening more frequently this year and causing severe damage.

There’s likely a connection between the storms that California has experienced and this week’s tornadoes. The atmospheric rivers and the rain they brought probably helped lead to increased moisture in the air, which enabled the recent tornadoes to form in the region, says Perry Samson, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Michigan. “You’ve got the conditions for instability set up by these atmospheric rivers,” Samson told Vox.

The increased intensity of atmospheric rivers may also have links to climate change, many climate experts say. It’s too early to draw conclusions about the relationship between climate change and the tornadoes, however. “You can’t tie it to climate change, because it’s a one-off thing,” says Jase Bernhardt, a professor of geology, environment, and sustainability at Hofstra University.

What is more established, though, is that it’s unusual for the Los Angeles area to experience this type of weather phenomena at this magnitude. “This is stuff you see in Ohio, Arkansas … Not Montebello,” one witness said, according to CNN.

The tornado occurred amid the rise of extreme weather

There have been growing instances of extreme weather worldwide over the last few decades, with a 2020 United Nations report noting a huge uptick in major natural disasters from 2000 to 2019, compared to previous decades. That report attributed a surge in instances of flooding and storms to global warming.

While climate change’s relationship to these tornadoes is uncertain, what is evident is that thunderstorms and tornadoes of this magnitude are uncommon in this region, and that this week’s events were a product of the right conditions being in place. Those include warmer, humid air near the ground and drier, cold air higher in the atmosphere. The warmer air contributing to recent extreme weather could also become more common as global warming worsens, as could storms. Climate change leads to warmer air, and “warmer air can hold more moisture,” which can mean more precipitation, per the New York Times.

“The Carpinteria and Montebello tornadoes formed after recent storms pushed cold air high into the atmosphere, causing it to destabilize. That created thunderstorm cells, which then began to rotate and ultimately become tornadoes,” the Los Angeles Times reports. That combination doesn’t happen very often in Los Angeles due to its topography, says Samson.

Both tornadoes caused notable property damage, with the Montebello one ripping a roof off a building and leading to one minor injury, and the Carpenteria one affecting 25 mobile homes.

The tornadoes follow a tumultuous few months for the state, which is continuing to grapple with drought, wildfires, and flooding. Experts noted that they don’t expect the state to see an uptick in tornadoes at this time, however, because the specific factors leading to the recent ones were likely unique.

“I wouldn’t say that with climate change, we should expect more tornadoes in California. It’s too rare of an event,” says Judah Cohen, a climatologist at MIT."
2023-03-24,2023-03-23 18:10:00,"How the US can stop the spread of Candida auris, a drug-resistant fungus",https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/23/23653504/candida-auris-fungus-cdc-vaccine-prevention,Science,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sounded the alarm earlier this week over the recent, rapid spread in health care facilities of a drug-resistant fungus that can cause deadly infections in immunocompromised individuals.

First discovered in 2009, Candida auris, or C. auris, has now been found in over half of US states. The number of infections rose 59 percent between 2019 and 2020 — and again by 95 percent in 2021 — to a total of 1,471 recorded cases, according to a paper released Monday.

While the fungus usually doesn’t pose a risk to healthy people, it is a risk to patients who are already very ill, particularly those in nursing homes and who have breathing tubes, feeding tubes, catheters, or other medical devices inserted in their bodies. Between 30 and 60 percent of people infected with the fungus have died, but that is based on a limited number of patients, and it’s unclear whether the fungus or another medical condition caused their death.

Candida auris seems to increasingly resist typical antifungal treatments called echinocandins. While researchers are trying to develop a vaccine targeting Candida auris and other common fungal infections, we’re years away from that potentially becoming a reality. For now, public health officials are focused on stopping the spread, which is difficult given just how persistent the fungus can be: It can spread person to person, living in their skin and body, but also via surfaces that it colonizes, such as furniture in a patient’s room, where it is resistant to many common disinfectants.

“It’s very sticky. It’s hardy in the environment,” said Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine.

How to prevent Candida auris from spreading

Roberts said that public health policy needs to be centered on improving lab infrastructure and screening protocols so that cases can quickly be identified and reported.

“The key is really being able to identify cases appropriately. And then once you identify them to isolate them or cohort those patients so they don’t spread it to other people,” he said.

One roadblock is that many labs aren’t equipped to identify Candida auris because they have older fungal libraries that cannot detect this particular new species. There have also been many cases of labs misidentifying the fungus as another species.

If medical professionals have a suspicion that a patient might have Candida auris, they typically have to send a sample to their state public health lab, which can take days to over a week to deliver a result. They should be isolating the patient and using the appropriate protective equipment and disinfectants in that period, as the CDC has recommended. But if they haven’t been doing so, the prospect of stopping further contagion becomes difficult.

Beyond building up lab capacity to identify cases, care providers need to enact stricter protocols to test and limit exposure to individuals who are at high risk for infection. Roberts said he’s previously worked at a facility that proactively screened patients who had been on ventilators, were coming from nursing homes, or had recently traveled internationally and found cases that would have never otherwise been identified. That’s not really being done in most parts of the country right now, he said.

“You have to have some sort of active surveillance mechanism where you can identify those at high risk when they get to the hospital or in whatever facility they’re at if it’s a high-prevalence region. I think that’s the best strategy we have right now to stop the spread,” he said.

Stopping the spread is critical because a Candida auris infection can be very difficult, if not impossible, to treat. Even when antifungals are effective against it, those drugs can be harsh on the liver. And when the drugs don’t work, the fungus can live in the body for years — or even indefinitely.

Will a vaccine for Candida auris become available?

We don’t currently have any vaccines for fungal infections, and as my colleague Keren Landman writes, “it’s not for lack of trying.” But the researchers working on preventive measures say that the rapid spread of Candida auris adds urgency to the mission for a drug-resistant fungal vaccine moonshot.

“There needs to be a vaccine. And it needs to be supported right now,” said Karen Norris, an immunologist at the University of Georgia’s veterinary school, who leads a team developing a potential fungal vaccine.

With the support of the National Institutes of Health, her team is designing a fungal vaccine to be cross-protective against several different fungal pathogens, potentially including Candida auris. They demonstrated in a paper published last year that the vaccine will induce an immune response in animals and particularly those that are immunosuppressed or immunocompromised.

They have yet to test it on humans. A phase one clinical trial would still be more than a year away, and that’s assuming they have the funding to undertake it.

“We are looking at the process for scaling up the manufacturing of this vaccine for development and for safety studies down the road in people,” Norris said. “We are hoping to partner [with the private sector] to advance this at a more rapid pace than where we are right now.”"

2023-03-24,2023-03-23 14:57:43,Invasive group A strep on the rise in parts of the US: What to know,https://6abc.com/invasive-strep-a-outbreak-cdc-group-symptoms/12996553/,Health,"Cases of invasive group A strep infections, which can cause severe illness and be deadly, remain elevated in some parts of the country, officials warned.

Five children have died of invasive Strep A so far this year in Illinois.

Cases of invasive group A strep infections, which can cause severe illness and be deadly, remain elevated in some parts of the country, officials warned Wednesday.

In a statement to ABC News, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that ""preliminary"" data from 2023 suggests cases have remained elevated above pre-pandemic levels in some areas of the U.S.

This follows confirmed reports that five children have died of invasive Strep A so far this year in Illinois.

WATCH: Illinois' top doctor warns of strep throat in children after 5 pediatric deaths reported

After a lull of invasive Strep A cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, cases of invasive Strep A have been ticking up again. The CDC warned in December that cases of Invasive Strep A were on the rise. The WHO first reported a surge of GAS infections across several countries that same month. Data from the U.K. revealed that in late 2022, there was nearly triple the number of Group A Strep infections than the same period over the last five years.

The CDC told ABC News Wednesday that the number of invasive strep A illnesses in children in the U.S. have returned to -- and in some places exceeded -- levels seen prior to the pandemic.

In December, the CDC warned that cases of Invasive Strep A were on the rise. A subsequent CDC analysis suggested a roughly threefold increase of cases in Colorado and Minnesota during October through December 2022, as compared to pre-pandemic years.

""Preliminary 2023 data indicate that [ invasive Strep A ] infections have remained high in children in some areas of the country even after some respiratory viruses decreased in those areas,"" the CDC said in a statement. ""Some areas of the country are seeing higher levels than were seen pre-COVID-19 pandemic.""

The typical Strep A season runs from December through April, according to the CDC.

Here are five questions answered about the condition, from how to treat it to how to lessen the risk.

1. What causes invasive group A strep?

Group A Strep (GAS) is a common bacteria which lives on our skin and often in our throats. It can cause different types of infections, most often strep throat.

Rarely, it can cause severe infections like streptococcal toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis, a rare bacterial infection.

The severe infections occur when strep A bacteria invades other parts of the body like the bloodstream or spinal fluid.

2. How common is invasive group A strep?

Invasive group A strep is a dangerous but rare disease that leads to around 1,500 to 2,300 deaths in the United States annually, according to the CDC.

The agency says between 14,000 and 25,000 cases usually occur each year.

Cases of invasive group A strep are more common among children.

3. How is invasive group A strep treated?

The condition is usually treated in the hospital with IV antibiotics and other supportive measures.

The treatment for mild to moderate strep infections is amoxicillin, which is on national shortage. If strep goes untreated or undertreated, it can lead to invasive group A strep.

At this stage, there is no data to suggest a direct link between the shortage of amoxicillin and the spike in cases.

4. What are the most common symptoms of invasive group A strep?

Doctors tell ABC News that all cases of strep should be seen by a doctor, severe or not.

Parents and caregivers should be on the lookout for fever, sore throat, trouble swallowing, or kids not acting like themselves.

Parents should also keep an eye out for signs of toxic shock syndrome and ""flesh-eating"" skin infections, which can be a sign that a strep infection is invasive. Symptoms of toxic shock include fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea and vomiting, according to the CDC.

Early signs of a serious skin infection include a fast-spreading swollen area of skin, severe pain and fever. Later on it might look like blisters, changes in skin color or pus at the infected area.

5. How can a person lessen their exposure to invasive group A strep?

Because strep spreads through coughs and sneezes and surfaces, practicing good hygiene -- like washing hands, surfaces and plates or glasses -- can keep it from spreading.

Viral infections can set the stage for a subsequent bacterial infection in the lungs, so parents and caregivers should also make sure children are up to date on flu and COVID-19 vaccinations in order to help protect them."
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 00:16:18,Scientists create mice from two dads after making eggs from skin cells,https://abc7news.com/scientists-create-mice-two-dads/13007421/,Science,"Scientists have created mice with two biologically male parents for the first time - a significant milestone in reproductive biology.

JAPAN -- Scientists have created mice with two biologically male parents for the first time - a significant milestone in reproductive biology.

The team, led by Katsuhiko Hayashi, a professor of genome biology at Osaka University in Japan, generated eggs from the skin cells of male mice that, when implanted in female mice, went on to produce healthy pups, according to research published March 15 in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.

The proof-of-concept research, the culmination of years of pain-staking lab work, could expand the possibilities for future fertility treatments, including for same-sex couples, and perhaps help prevent the extinction of endangered animals.

However, scientists warn there's still much to learn before cultured cells can be used to make human eggs in a lab dish.

""It is expected that application into humans takes a long time, maybe 10 years or more. Even if it is applied, we never know whether the eggs are safe enough to produce (a) baby,"" Hayashi said.

Skin cells reprogrammed from mice tails

The researchers took skin cells from the tails of fully grown male lab mice, which, as in male humans, contain one X and one Y chromosome, and turned them into induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs - a type of cell that scientists have reprogrammed into an embryonic state.

This process of genetic engineering, which introduces specific genes to create cells that mimic embryonic stem cells, was pioneered by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Shinya Yamanaka.

(Induced pluripotent stem cells, which can be developed into any kind of human cell, are widely used in biological research to model and investigate human diseases and develop drugs.)

When the iPSCs are cultured in the lab, a few spontaneously lose the Y chromosome, which isn't essential for the growth of this particular type of cell, generating ""XO"" cells, Hayashi explained.

The researchers cultured the XO cells and found that some cells developed two X chromosomes as a result of cell division errors - making them chromosomally female. Treating the XO cells with a compound called reversine increased the number of XX cells, the researchers found.

From there, the team converted the XX cells into primordial germ cells, the precursors of eggs and sperm, that were subsequently programmed with the signals to turn them into egg cells. Once fertilized with sperm and implanted into a mouse uterus, the eggs generated live offspring.

""This study is particularly neat because it takes advantage of errors that are known to occur during culture of XY cells, which lead to loss of the Y chromosome and subsequent gain of a second X chromosome, resulting in XX cells that are capable of generating live offspring,"" said Rod Mitchell, a professor of developmental endocrinology at the MRC Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in a statement. He wasn't involved in the research.

""However, its potential application for humans (e.g. for same-sex couples) remains to be seen. In the mouse study, very few of the embryos generated using mouse cells resulted in live offspring and the final steps required to convert germ cells into eggs have not been reliably reproduced using human cells,"" added Mitchell, who is also a consultant pediatric endocrinologist at the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh.

Only 7 out of 630 implanted mouse embryos gave rise to mouse pups. Hayashi said this low success rate - around 1% - wasn't down to the process of sex chromosome conversion but the reality that cells cultured in a lab are typically inferior to those in a living animal.

""This is due to the suboptimal condition of the culture system. Especially, if the culture period is long (in this case 5-6 weeks), then the cell potential is compromised,"" Hayashi said via email.

What's next?

Hayashi's research has raised the possibility that someday same-sex couples may be able to have a baby who shares both parents' genes.

""It (will be) difficult to produce babies from male-male (human) couples because of both technical and ethical reasons,"" Hayashi said. ""But it is theoretically possible to produce babies from male-male couples, as shown in this study.""

He said that it would be more challenging to accomplish the reverse - that is, making sperm from female cells because they contain no Y chromosome, which is essential for making sperm. Duplicating an X chromosome, which male cells already have, is easier than conjuring up a Y chromosome in female cells, Hayashi explained.

Glenn Cohen, the James A. Attwood and Leslie Williams Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, said the work raised thorny ethical and legal questions that society needed to start thinking about.

These issues include embryo farming - producing hundreds of embryos to pick the best one - and the unauthorized use of a person's cells.

""What happens to all the embryos created but not used? Does it violate ethical norms of respect to create so many potential human lives knowing that the vast majority will be destroyed or indefinitely stored?"" said Cohen, who is also the faculty director of Harvard Law's Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology & Bioethics.

""In the most extreme case, imagine an individual using sloughed skin cells left on a bathtub by Brad Pitt, for example, to derive sperm or egg in order to reproduce,"" he added.

Saving animals from extinction?

The technique holds promise for conserving endangered species, although it's not known whether the process in mice that resulted in the spontaneous loss of a Y chromosome and the duplication of the X chromosome would occur in other mammal species, said Mike McGrew, Personal Chair of Avian Reproductive Technologies at The Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh.

""This is a very exciting finding for species conservation,"" he said via email. ""You could imagine that the many 'biobanks' that are being established to capture genetic diversity stored for endangered species of animals. By chance, only or predominantly male cells may be conserved for some species.""

The techniques developed by Hayashi could help the northern white rhino breeding program, said Thomas Hildebrandt, professor and chair of wildlife reproduction medicine at Freie Universitt Berlin and head of reproduction management at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research.

Only two animals of the species remain in the world, and both are female, Hildebrandt is attempting to artificially breed the animals with sperm and tissue samples taken from now deceased male counterparts.

""It's a technology for tomorrow but we have an option to create a genetically sound population. This is only possible with this stem cell approach,"" Hildebrandt said.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 22:51:12,Rising seas will cut off many properties before they’re flooded,https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926888,Science,"Climate change produces lots of risks that are difficult to predict. While it will make some events—heatwaves, droughts, extreme storms, etc.—more probable, all of those events depend heavily on year-to-year variation in the weather. So, while the odds may go up, it's impossible to know when one of these events will strike a given location.

In contrast, sea level rise seems far simpler. While there's still uncertainty about just how quickly ocean levels will rise, other aspects seem pretty predictable. Given a predicted rate of sea level rise, it's easy to tell when a site will start ending up underwater. And that sort of analysis has been done for various regions.

But having a property above water won't be much good if flooding nearby means you can't get to a hospital or grocery store when you need to or lose access to electricity or other services. It's entirely possible for rising seas to leave a property high, dry, but uninhabitable as rising seas cut connections to essential services. A group of researchers has analyzed the risk of isolation driven by sea level rise, and shows it's a major contributor to the future risks the US faces.

Off-site risks

Conceptually, isolation is pretty easy to understand. While some people on the coast may live on relatively high ground, access to their homes can involve a road that goes through low-lying areas. As such, sea level rise can mean people living there start to lose road access due to flooding at high tide long before any ocean shows up on the property. While things like trips for groceries can be planned around tidal flooding, access to things like schools and emergency services typically can't be planned around the tides.

Inundation of roads can also weaken their foundations, leading to failure or maintenance that can take them out of use. Finally, we often run critical infrastructure—water and sewer lines, electricity, networking—along roadways. So there are various ways that losing road access, even from periodic flooding, can make living somewhere untenable.

To find out how significant this sort of isolation could be, a team of researchers (Tom Logan and Mitchell Anderson from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, and Allison Reilly of the University of Maryland) used OpenStreetMap to track every street in the US's 48 contiguous states and compared them to sea level rise projections developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Using three scenarios for future ocean levels (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 meters of rise by the end of the century), they tracked every neighborhood's access to its nearest essential facility, such as a public school or fire station, determining when intervening roads were going to be flooded during high tides.

While this is inexact, it reasonably indicates when transit to and from a neighborhood starts to become impractical. This doesn't mean the ocean completely cuts off the road, but it does mean that flooding will be a regular issue.

The bad news is that there's no good news

The results make it clear that isolation will be a significant problem for the US. Even under the lowest sea level rise scenario (0.5 meters by 2100), over half a million people will be at risk of isolation in 2080—and that's in addition to the people whose property will be regularly inundated. Under the intermediate scenario, that number rises to nearly a million people.

There were several ways to view the added risk. For some neighborhoods, for example, isolation will occur at ocean levels two meters below what's needed to flood the area. The risk of isolation is also accelerated compared to inundation; some neighborhoods that won't see floods until 2060 will end up isolated as early as 2030 under the rapid sea level rise scenario. And the researchers estimate that 4 million residents would be at risk of isolation in neighborhoods that would remain above water even under the high sea level rise scenario.

These risks are also spread unevenly. For example, the risk of isolation is higher in Maine than in Florida, although Florida's larger population means that more people would be at risk.

Regardless of the details, however, the work makes it clear that there's far more at risk than individual property from sea level rise and that many places will become far less livable long before the water starts lapping at doors. On the positive side, there are indications that some states are focused on preserving essential infrastructure. But it's unclear whether that sort of foresight has become part of the considerations for homeowners and property developers.

If you're interested in comparing the risk of isolation to that of inundation, the researchers have built a website that lets you explore the risks under different sea level rise scenarios.

Scheme depicting various steps in the chemical synthesis of the prebiotic genetic alphabet Barbitudine and its corresponding triphosphate Barbitudine triphosphate (BaTP) 44 — biorxiv

RNA-based genetic code is thought to be central to life’s emergence due to its dual ability for information transfer and catalysis. Nonetheless, the genetic code of early life was potentially not restricted to canonical genetic alphabets alone.

The presence of an extensive repertoire of modified nucleobases in extant biology as ‘signatures of the past’, highlights the relevance of non-canonical alphabets, ably strengthened by experiments demonstrating their ready conversion into nucleosides and nucleotides.

All these strongly support a pre-RNA World, wherein informational molecules are posited to have contained alternate genetic alphabets. Nevertheless, understanding pre-RNA molecules’ capacity to acquire emergent function has remained less prevalent. Further, the steps involved in their transition to a canonical RNA World has not been systematically studied in the origins of life framework.

In this study, we report the synthesis of a prebiotically relevant genetic alphabet containing the non-canonical nucleobase, barbituric acid. We demonstrate for the first instance the enzymatic incorporation of this prebiotically plausible alphabet (BaTP) into an RNA, using proteinaceous T7 RNA polymerase.

Pertinently, the incorporation of this genetic alphabet into a baby spinach aptamer did not affect its overall secondary structure, while also allowing it to retain its aptameric function. Furthermore, we demonstrate the faithful transfer of genetic information from pre-RNA-containing barbitudine nucleotides to DNA, using a high-fidelity RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. These findings allude to a putative pathway for the early molecular evolution of the genetic code of extant life.

NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is cruising back to Earth with a sample it collected from the rocky surface of asteroid Bennu. When its sample capsule parachutes down into the Utah desert on Sept. 24, OSIRIS-REx will become the United States’ first-ever mission to return an asteroid sample to Earth.

After seven years in space, including a nail-biting touchdown on Bennu to gather dust and rocks, this intrepid mission is about to face one of its biggest challenges yet: deliver the asteroid sample to Earth while protecting it from heat, vibrations, and earthly contaminants.

“Once the sample capsule touches down, our team will be racing against the clock to recover it and get it to the safety of a temporary clean room,” said Mike Moreau, deputy project manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Members of NASA’s OSIRIS-REx curation team work with a glove box at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. The curation team will be among the first to see and handle the sample OSIRIS-REx is returning from asteroid Bennu. They are also responsible for storing and distributing the sample to science team members around the world. Most of the sample will be stored for future generations. Credits: NASA Johnson/Bill Stafford

So, over the next six months, the OSIRIS-REx team will practice and refine the procedures required to recover the sample in Utah and transport it to a new lab built for the material at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, scientists will unpack the sample, distribute up to a quarter of it to the OSIRIS-REx science team around the world for analysis, and curate the rest for other scientists to study, now and in future generations.

Flight dynamics engineers from NASA Goddard and KinetX Aerospace are reviewing the trajectory that will bring the spacecraft close to Earth. At Lockheed Martin in Denver, team members are keeping tabs on the spacecraft and preparing a group to recover the sample capsule. This summer, crews in Colorado and Utah will practice all of the steps to recover the capsule safely, while protecting it from contamination. At Johnson Space Center, the curation team is rehearsing their procedure to unpack and process the sample inside glove boxes. Meanwhile, members of the sample science team are preparing the investigations they will perform with the sample material once received.

“The OSIRIS-REx team has already performed amazing feats characterizing and sampling asteroid Bennu,” said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator from the University of Arizona, Tucson. “These accomplishments are the direct result of the extensive training and rehearsals that we performed every step of the way. We are bringing that level of discipline and dedication to this final phase of the flight operations.”

Asteroids are the ancient materials left over from the original era of planet formation and may contain molecular precursors to life. Scientists have learned a great deal from studying asteroid fragments that have naturally reached the ground as meteorites. But to understand whether asteroids played a role in delivering these compounds to Earth’s surface over 4 billion years ago, scientists need a pristine sample from space, free from terrestrial contaminants.



Diagram of Sample Return capsule — NASA

In addition, the most fragile rocks observed on Bennu probably would not have survived passage through Earth’s atmosphere as meteorites. “There are two things pervasive on Earth: water and biology,” said Dr. Jason Dworkin, OSIRIS-REx project scientist at NASA Goddard. “Both can severely alter meteorites when they land on the ground and muddle the story told by the sample’s chemistry and mineralogy. A pristine sample could provide insights into the development of solar system.”

On Sept. 24, as the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft flies by Earth, it will release its sample return capsule, thereby ending its primary mission. The capsule, which is estimated to hold about a cup of Bennu’s material – 8.8 ounces +/- 3.6 ounces (250 grams +/- 101 grams) to be precise – will land within a 37-mile by 9-mile ellipse (59 km by 15 km) within Department of Defense property that is part of the Utah Test and Training Range and Dugway Proving Grounds.

OSIRIS-REx team members from NASA Goddard, KinetX, Lockheed Martin, and NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, are using computer models to test navigation plans in various weather, solar activity, and space debris scenarios to ensure that when the capsule enters Earth’s atmosphere at 10:41 a.m. ET (8:41 a.m. MT), it will touch down inside the targeted area 13 minutes later.

Recovery crews are responsible for securing the sample return capsule’s landing site and helicoptering it to a portable clean room located at the range. Additionally, crews will collect soil and air samples all around the landing capsule. These samples will help identify if any minute contaminants contacted the asteroid sample.

Once the capsule is inside the building with the portable clean room, members of the team will remove the heat shield, back shell, and other components to prepare the sample canister for transport to Houston.

The return to Earth of samples from asteroid Bennu will be the culmination of a more than 12-year effort by NASA and its mission partners but marks the beginning of a new phase of discovery as scientists from around the world will turn their attention to the analysis of this unique and precious material dating from the early formation of our solar system.

NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center provides overall mission management, systems engineering, and the safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona, Tucson, is the principal investigator. The university leads the science team and the mission’s science observation planning and data processing. Lockheed Martin Space in Littleton, Colorado, built the spacecraft and provides flight operations. Goddard and KinetX Aerospace are responsible for navigating the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Curation for OSIRIS-REx, including processing the sample when it arrives on Earth, will take place at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. International partnerships on this mission include the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter instrument from the Canadian Space Agency and asteroid sample science collaboration with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Hayabusa2 mission. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers Program, managed by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate Washington.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 21:22:14,California ends some water limits after storms ease drought,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/california-ends-water-limits-storms-ease-drought-rcna76620,Science,"DUNNIGAN, Calif. — California Gov. Gavin Newsom ended some of the state’s water restrictions on Friday because a winter of relentless rain and snow has replenished the state’s reservoirs and eased fears of a shortage after three years of severe drought.

Most of California is no longer in drought, according to an update by the U.S. Drought Monitor on Thursday. But water shortage concerns remain for some areas of the state, including the Klamath River basin along the California-Oregon border and in Southern California, which relies on the struggling Colorado River system to help supply millions of people.

“Are we out of a drought? Mostly — but not completely,” Newsom said Friday from a farm northwest of Sacramento that has flooded its fields to help replenish groundwater.

Newsom on Friday stopped asking people to voluntarily cut their water use by 15%, a request he first made nearly two years ago while standing at the edge of a nearly dry Lopez Lake in the state’s Central Coast region — a lake that today is so full from recent storms it is almost spilling over. Californians never met Newsom’s call for that level of conservation — as of January the cumulative savings were just 6.2%.

The governor also said he would ease rules requiring local water agencies to impose restrictions on customers. That order will impact people in different ways depending on where they live. For most people, it means they won’t be limited to watering their lawns on only certain days of the week or at certain times of the day. Other restrictions remain in place, including a ban on watering decorative grass for businesses.

Newsom could ease those restrictions in part because state officials said California’s reservoirs are now so full that cities will get will more than double the amount of drinking water this year compared to a previous allocation announced last month. Water districts that serve 27 million people will get at least 75% of the water they requested from state supplies. Last year, they only got 5% as California endured three of the driest years ever since modern recordkeeping began in 1896.

“I know that’s disappointing for some because it would be nice to have a governor say the drought is over,” Newsom said.

California and the western United States have been in an extended drought for about two decades, a period of abnormal dryness punctuated by occasional intense seasons of storms.

“Being the governor of a large, diverse state that has very diverse water supplies and water demands, it’s really tough for him to say a drought has started or a drought has ended. Everybody will interpret that a little differently,” said Jay Lund, vice director for the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.

Lund said the drought is over from many perspectives in California, including urban water supply and reservoirs. But it’s not over for the state’s fragile ecosystems and the groundwater aquifers that were depleted during recent drought years.

“We might never recover them completely,” he said.

Three years of little rain or snow in California had depleted reservoirs to the point the state couldn’t generate electricity from hydroelectric power plants. It dried up wells in rural areas and state officials had to truck in water supplies for some communities. And it reduced the flow of the state’s major rivers and streams, killing off endangered species of fish and other species.

But since December, no less than 12 powerful storms have hit California, packing so much rain and snow that meteorologists call them “atmospheric rivers.” These storms have flooded homes, closed ski resorts and trapped people in mountain communities for days with no electricity, prompting emergency declarations from President Joe Biden.

Amid all that carnage, water has steadily poured into the state’s reservoirs. Of California’s 17 major reservoirs, 12 of them are either at or above their historical averages for this time of year.

And more water is coming. Statewide, the amount of snow piled up in the mountains is already 223% above the April 1 average — the date when the snowpack is typically at its peak. Most of that snow will melt in the coming months, flowing into reservoirs and posing more flooding threats downstream.

“This is a good news moment. Those storms have brought record amounts of water into our state in the form of rain and snow, and that means we are in much better condition with our water supply than we were in the fall,” said Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency.

California doesn’t have enough room in its reservoirs to store all of the water from these storms. In fact, some reservoirs are having to release water to make room for new storms coming next week and snowmelt in the spring. That’s why the Newsom administration has given farmers permission to take water out of the rivers and flood some of their fields, with the water seeping back under ground to refill groundwater basins.

Newsom made his drought announcement at one of those projects, a farm in the community of Dunnigan, off of Interstate 5 about 37 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of Sacramento. State officials hope projects like these will replenish some of the groundwater that was pumped out during the drought."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 21:11:02,Two more dead as patients report horrifying details of eye drop outbreak,https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926844,Science,"Two more people have died and more details of horrifying eye infections are emerging in a nationwide outbreak linked to recalled eye drops from EzriCare and Delsam.

The death toll now stands at three, according to an outbreak update this week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 68 people in 16 states have been infected with a rare, extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain linked to the eye drops. In addition to the deaths, eight people have reported vision loss and four have had their eyeballs surgically removed (enucleation).

In a case report published this week in JAMA Ophthalmology, eye doctors at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, part of the University of Miami Health System, reported details of one case linked to the outbreak—a case in a 72-year-old man who has an ongoing infection in his right eye with vision loss, despite weeks of treatment with multiple antibiotics. When the man first sought treatment he reported pain in his right eye, which only had the ability to detect motion at the point, while his left eye had 20/20 vision. Doctors noted that the white of his right eye was entirely red and white blood cells had visibly pooled on his cornea and in the front inner chamber of his eye.

The man's eye tested positive for a P. aeruginosa strain resistant to multiple antibiotics—as did the bottle of EzriCare artificial tear eye drops he had been using. After further testing, doctors switched the man's treatment plan to using hourly doses of antibiotics to which the bacterial strain was least resistant. At a one-month follow-up visit, the redness and eye infiltrates had improved in the man's eye. But to date, the infection has persisted, the doctors reported, as has his vision loss. (Graphic images of his right eye at the initial presentation and one-month follow-up can be found here.)

Growing outbreak

The CDC identified the outbreak strain as VIM-GES-CRPA, which stands for a carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) with Verona integron-mediated metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and Guiana extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (GES). This is an extensively drug-resistant strain that, before the outbreak, had never been seen in the US before. CDC officials fear the outbreak will lead to these types of infections becoming more common, as the bacteria can asymptomatically colonize in people, spread to others, and share their resistance genes.

Authorities believe that the outbreak strain was brought into the country in the contaminated eye drops, which were manufactured by Global Pharma, a Chennai, India-based manufacturer. The Food and Drug Administration reports that it has had a slew of manufacturing violations. The eye drops were imported into the country by Aru Pharma Inc. and then branded and sold by EzriCare and Delsam Pharma. The products were available nationwide via Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and other retailers.

ABC News on Thursday reported another case treated by doctors at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, in which a 68-year-old Miami woman lost an eye after using EzriCare drops . The woman, Clara Oliva, developed an infection in her right eye last August and went to the Institute for emergency care due to intense pain that she described as feeling like shards of glass in her eye. Doctors discovered the pain was due to a P. aeruginosa infection, but did not immediately link it to the eye drops. The doctors tried to surgically repair the eye but found extensive, irreparable damage and worried that the drug-resistant infection would spread. On September 1, they removed her infected eye entirely. Oliva, left legally blind by the enucleation and poor vision in her remaining eye, continued using the EzriCare eye drops until January when the CDC released the first advisory about the outbreak. She is now suing EzriCare, Global Pharma, the medical center that prescribed her the eye drops, and her insurer.

Oliva isn't the only one filing lawsuits. Last month, Jory Lange, a Houston-based attorney with expertise in food safety, filed two lawsuits on behalf of women affected by the outbreak.

""I think this outbreak is, unfortunately, likely to continue to grow,"" Lange told Ars. For one thing, people continue to be diagnosed, he said. But, the CDC has also advised clinicians to look at infections from early last year. As of now, the identified cases in the outbreak span from May 2022 to February 2023, but the CDC is advising clinicians to report any drug-resistant P. aeruginosa cases as far back as January 2022. ""We've talked to some people who were infected in that early time frame, so we think their cases will end up being added,"" Lange said."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 20:47:07,Why don’t we have vaccines for fungal infections?,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2023/2/11/23592955/last-of-us-fungal-vaccines-infections-cordyceps,Health,"The second episode of the HBO hit The Last Of Us opens with a scene in Jakarta, Indonesia. It’s set in 2003, at the beginning of a (fictional) fungal pandemic that goes on to destroy the world as we know it. After an expert in fungal biology evaluates the body of an infected factory worker, she speaks quietly to a military official who has asked for her help controlling the pathogen’s spread.

“There is no vaccine,” she says to his stricken face.

It was true in real-world 2003, and it’s true now: Although vaccines against bacterial and viral diseases abound, no vaccines against any fungal pathogens are licensed for human use. That’s particularly worrisome as real-world fungal threats make waves, most notably a massive recent rise in Candida auris, a yeast that causes life-threatening bloodstream infections in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients — and that’s increasingly resistant to anti-fungal treatments.

It’s not for lack of trying: Dennis Dixon, who leads bacterial and fungal research at the National Institutes of Health, said there’s been “continuous activity” aimed at developing fungal vaccines for decades. But a variety of challenges both scientific and economic have conscripted even more promising fungal vaccine candidates to the pharmacologic dustbin — to the detriment of human health.

The zombie-causing fungus in the show is mostly fictitious — at least, as a human pathogen. In reality, most severe fungal infections in humans affect immunocompromised people, including people with untreated HIV infection and those receiving cancer treatment, organ transplants, or medications for autoimmune diseases. (These usually manifest as lung and bloodstream infections or meningitis, and not zombification.)

However, some affect people with normal immune systems — ever had a yeast infection, or heard of valley fever? — and the global burden of fungal infections is expected to increase as the number of people receiving immunosuppressive drugs continues its upward climb and climate change accelerates.

The urgency of finding a vaccine to prevent any fungal infection — or ideally, preventing multiple types of fungal infections with one vaccine — is not new, but it’s growing.

Which raises the question: Why, in the year of our lord 2023, do we still not have any fungal vaccines? The answers highlight challenges in both the science and economics of vaccine development — and some idiosyncrasies about a kingdom of life already known for its very specific (and highly telegenic) weirdness.

A fungal vaccine would help prevent a lot of infections

Fungi are all around us: in the air we breathe, on the surfaces we touch, and all over the insides and the outsides of our bodies. Still, most of us are at low risk for fungal infections, as long as our immune systems are functioning normally.

The worst fungal infection likely to affect a person with a healthy immune system is probably one caused by a member of the Candida genus, which are technically yeasts (yes, yeasts are a type of fungus, as are mushrooms and molds). Vaginal yeast infections are an especially common form of candidal infection that often affects healthy people, leading to 1.4 million clinic visits a year in the US alone. Worldwide, an estimated 138 million women get four or more yeast infections a year. Other fungal infections common to healthy people include ringworm — which, surprise! isn’t caused by a worm at all — and infections of the nails on fingers or toes.

But fungal infections (including and beyond yeast infections) are a much bigger threat to people with compromised immune systems. Worldwide, fungi cause 13 million infections and 1.5 million deaths every year. And in 2018, treating these infections cost Americans nearly $7 billion.

Fungal infections are most common in immunosuppressed people. That complicates developing and deploying fungal vaccines.

The fact that the most severe fungal infections primarily affect immunosuppressed people creates some big challenges when it comes to developing vaccines to protect against them.

First of all, this makes it complicated to find participants for clinical trials testing fungal vaccines.

To determine whether a vaccine works, scientists need to test promising vaccine candidates — usually, prototypes that have successfully prevented the disease in experimentally infected animals —in large groups of humans. Because we live in a world with medical ethics, scientists can’t experimentally infect humans. Instead, they need to wait for people in the trial to naturally encounter the disease they’re trying to prevent.

The more rare that disease, the more people scientists need to follow (and for a longer time) to look for the disease. And while severe fungal infections are a growing problem, they’re still relatively uncommon.

Karen Norris, an immunologist at the University of Georgia’s veterinary school who leads a team developing a fungal vaccine candidate, said her team had “done the math” on the time it would take to study a hypothetical vaccine targeting a single fungal infection. “It’s doable, but it would take a couple of years to enroll that many patients,” she said.

It’s also hard to design vaccines that work for the immunocompromised people who need them the most. An effective vaccine works by training a person’s immune system to respond quickly to a certain germ — and suppressed immune systems are hard to safely train.

In some cases, it’s possible to predict immunosuppression — for example, when a person is preparing to receive chemotherapy or another immunosuppressive treatment. But not always: People with HIV and those who are born with immune system disorders can’t plan or predict the state of their immune systems.

That creates big challenges for scientists, who ideally want to develop vaccines that protect both people with healthy immune systems who go on to have immunosuppression, and those whose first diagnosis involves immunosuppression.

Another problem: Fungal cells have more similarities to human cells than do viruses or bacteria. That makes it more complicated to design a vaccine that trains the immune system to attack fungal cells without attacking our own cells.

The biggest barrier to fungal vaccines might be economic

Even if a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials, that doesn’t mean it will get to mass production and market: For that, it also needs to have the potential to make a profit. “The testing of a vaccine in this space is, to be honest, not that attractive to big pharma, etc., because they are not infections that occur at a high frequency in a lot of patients,” said Norris.

Even if a vaccine prevents a lot of illness and death in a group of people — and reduces the costs of their medical care — those benefits accrue to individuals and health care systems, not to the pharmaceutical companies who incur the costs of developing and producing the vaccine.

“It’s going to take someone to develop that tough market for this to go forward,” said Dixon. A viable vaccine will need to not only be effective at preventing disease, but effective at doing so in enough people to make producing the vaccine at scale a worthwhile investment for pharmaceutical companies.

Still, people are working on fungal vaccines, and there are a few promising candidates

Regardless of the obstacles, people are working to develop fungal vaccines — and have been for decades.

To overcome the economic inviability of developing vaccines that prevent only a small number of infections, several scientists are developing vaccines that prevent multiple fungal infections — or better yet, all of them.

Norris’s group has developed a prototype targeting three fungi responsible for 80 percent of all infections in immunocompromised people: Candida, Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis. The prototype significantly reduced illness and deaths due to these infections in experimental mice and primates. A wide variety of other candidates are also being studied.

Three fungal vaccines have made it into the human clinical trial stage to date. In the early 1980s, a trial of a vaccine to prevent infections with Coccidioides — the fungus that causes valley fever — didn’t reduce infections, and produced lots of side effects. More recently, two vaccines aimed at preventing Candida (i.e., yeast) infections had good results in human safety trials, one of which looked to be effective at preventing recurrent vaginal infections in a small, placebo-controlled trial. But without an investor to take testing to the next level — a clinical trial comparing the vaccine to standard preventive therapy — development stalled out, said Dixon.

That’s particularly regrettable because that vaccine, called NDV-3A, showed promise of preventing Candida auris, which the Centers for Disease Control and Protection now reports is rising at alarming rates. People at risk for infections with this germ are those who are already severely ill or have invasive medical devices (like dialysis catheters). The CDC recently published data indicating a threefold increase in both the overall number of cases between 2019 and 2021, and in the proportion of cases that were drug-resistant.

In animal trials, NDV-3A reduced Candida auris’s disease-causing activity, augmented the immune system’s response to it, and enhanced the protectiveness of drugs to which the yeast is often resistant. However, human trials of the vaccine against this emerging threat never materialized.

Norris said additional animal safety studies of her team’s prototype could take another year. If those go well, the next step — a safety trial in humans — would also take about a year. After that, at least several more years of work await before her team has a licensed vaccine produced at scale.

So while any progress on fungal vaccines feels momentous, it’s wise to stay grounded about the timeline of progress in this space, said Dixon. “It’s certainly going to be a while to figure out how to get the science right, to get the protection right,” he said, “and get to the goal line.”

Update, March 24, 4:50 pm ET: This story was originally published on February 11 and has been updated to reflect recently published CDC data on Candida auris and the promise of one vaccine candidate against the pathogen in animal trials."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 19:47:02,Blue Origin blames New Shepard mishap on engine nozzle failure,https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-blames-new-shepard-mishap-on-engine-nozzle-failure/,Technology,"WASHINGTON — Blue Origin says it is preparing to resume flights of its New Shepard suborbital vehicle after completing an investigation into a failed launch last September.

Blue Origin announced March 24 that its investigation into the NS-23 launch concluded that the nozzle in the BE-3PM engine in the rocket’s propulsion module suffered a structural failure that caused a thrust misalignment. That triggered the abort motor in the vehicle’s crew capsule, taking it away from the propulsion module. The capsule, which carried payloads but no people on the Sept. 12 flight, landed safely under parachutes.

The propulsion module, called Tail 3 by the company, shut down the BE-3PM engine after the nozzle failure, and crashed within a predicted area at the company’s Launch Site One in West Texas. A mishap investigation team organized by Blue Origin recovered “all critical flight hardware” within days of the mishap.

That investigation found evidence structural fatigue failure in the engine nozzle, which it linked to temperatures that exceeded its design. “Forensic evaluation of the recovered nozzle fragments also showed clear evidence of thermal damage and hot streaks resulting from increased operating temperatures,” the company stated. “The fatigue location on the flight nozzle is aligned with a persistent hot streak identified during the investigation.”

Ground tests of the engine found that its flight configuration was running hotter than expected. Investigators concluded “design changes made to the engine’s boundary layer cooling system accounted for an increase in nozzle heating and explained the hot streaks present.” The company did not elaborate on the nature of the design changes.

Blue Origin said that it is making design changes to the combustion chamber of the BE-3PM and its operating parameters. Additional, unspecified design changes to the nozzle also improved its structural performance.

The company said it would resume flights of New Shepard “soon” starting with the reflight of the payload-only NS-23 mission. It was not more specific about the schedule and did not state when it would resume crewed flights.

The company had said little about the investigation in the six months since the mishap. “We will get to the bottom of it,” said Gary Lai, chief architect of New Shepard at Blue Origin, during a talk at a suborbital research conference Feb. 28. “I can’t talk about specific timelines or plans for when we will resolve that situation other than to say that we fully intend to be back in business as soon as we are ready.”

“We are still closing out the investigation. We’re working very closely with the FAA,” said Ariane Cornell, vice president of commercial orbital, astronaut and international sales at Blue Origin, during a panel at the Satellite 2023 conference March 15. “We’re going into very deep, deep detail on that.”

She said that the company was planning to return New Shepard to flight “by the end of this year,” but was not more specific. She noted that escape system on the vehicle worked “perfectly” on NS-23, a point the company emphasized in its statement about the investigation: “The Crew Capsule escape system worked as designed, bringing the capsule and its payloads to a safe landing at Launch Site One with no damage.”

Cornell noted the company had not lost any customers for its crewed flights since the mishap. “Demand continues to be strong,” she said. “We continue to have customers signing up for New Shepard. Some of those even asked to fly an ‘escape’ mission because it seemed so exciting. We have politely declined.”"

Bark With Bite

Ubisoft, one of the world's largest video game developers known for titles like the ""Assassin's Creed"" franchise, is moving to partially automate writing in-game dialog by developing an AI tool called Ghostwriter.

In video games, non-player characters (NPCs) often speak in what are known as ""barks"": short, often shouty lines of dialogue triggered by in-game events — a ""Watch those wrist rockets!"" a quick ""Reloadin'!"" or a tired ""Took an arrow to the knee."" To hear Ubisoft tell it, drafting those innumerable quips is the perfect application for machine learning.

""Ghostwriter isn't replacing the video game writer, but instead, alleviating one of the video game writer's most laborious tasks: writing barks,"" the developer assured in a press release. ""Ghostwriter effectively generates first drafts of barks — phrases or sounds made by NPCs during a triggered event — which gives scriptwriters more time to polish the narrative elsewhere.""

Dicey Dialogue

A writer using Ghostwriter would start by creating a character, and then specifying the line of dialogue or interaction they want to generate based on a selected mode, e.g. ""confident,"" ""excited,"" or ""irritation."" The AI then churns out a bunch of different variations in pairs, which the writer can then choose the best of between the two, and manually edit.

""Rather than writing first draft versions themselves, Ghostwriter lets scriptwriters select and polish the samples generated,"" said Ben Swanson, the creator of Ghostwriter and an R&D scientist at Ubisoft LaForge, in the release, adding that the software will become smarter and finer tuned the more a writer uses it, as it picks up on their preferences.

During a talk at the Games Developer Conference this week, Swanson compared Ghostwriter to rolling a 30,000-sided die with each face corresponding to a word, and then rolling it over and over again until you have a full sentence, as quoted by Game Developer.

Forget ChatGPT

Swanson also affirmed that the tool requires human input and wouldn't work if Ubisoft's writers weren't already enthusiastic about using it.

Addressing the industry's uneasy foray into AI, Swanson urged other developers to not use other generative-AI like OpenAI's ChatGPT and to instead develop their own tools, warning that they may not own the content it produces or the data going into it.

""You don't know what these companies are going to do,"" he said. ""If you're trying to build these systems, keep lines of communication and talk to narrative designers and scriptwriters.""

As the snow melts outside, Kura Home Maintenance Owner Daniel Felts says homeowners should be outside, too, cleaning gutters and digging out downspouts.

""It's really easy for this downspout to become detached, and if that water is pouring right next to your home, it's not getting it 4- to 10-feet away, and that water's gonna seep in right next to your foundation there, and that can cause your sump pump to work harder,"" Felt said.

RELATED: Stillwater declares state of emergency ahead of dire spring flooding forecast

To help prevent water damage, he encourages people to shovel a perimeter around their home, especially around windows and doors.

""You want to see water coming out of your sump pump and getting away from your house,"" he said.

To make sure your sump pump is working right, make sure any outdoor drainage hoses are thawed, and give the sump pump a practice run.

""Just taking a bucket of water, you can pour that in. And as you pour that in, that's gonna simulate water coming into your sump pump, and you want to just make sure that this can handle enough water,"" he said.

Homeowners can also place affordable water sensors around their home to alert if water has entered the space.

""Once it starts warming up, that's when it's going to start melting and we'll get those phone calls,"" Gary Colemasan, project manager with Paul Davis Restoration.

Colemasan says spring is the busiest time of year, especially in Minnesota.

""Since we know we live in Minnesota and we know we're gonna have this problem, moving furniture away from your walls, having dehumidifiers yourself just in your basement is a good preventive measure,"" he said.

Most standard home insurance policies don't have flood insurance, but you can choose to upgrade. Keep in mind that there is a 30-day waiting period before it goes into effect.

The right and center lanes were completely blocked. All trucks were being asked to exit eastbound I-80 at 4th Street because there was not enough clearance to pass the overturned truck, the CHP said.

The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but wind gusts were measured as high as 70 mph on the bridge at the time of the crash.

""We don't know for sure, but we do suspect that the high winds on the bridge may have been a contributing factor to the truck overturning,"" CHP Officer Mark Andrews said.

People were advised to avoid the bridge and use alternative routes such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Mateo Bridge.

Andrews told KPIX a tow truck was being brought from the East Bay, requiring a full if brief closure to all eastbound traffic. Once that tow truck arrived at the accident scene, authorities were able to reopen two lanes temporarily.

However, as of 7 p.m., Andrews said crews were awaiting a second tow truck in order to get the truck upright to remove it, a process that would require all lanes to be closed again during the process.

By 8:13 p.m., the second tow truck had arrived and the big rig had been uprighted, with two lanes open for traffic.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Six months ago, we told you about a young woman who was diagnosed with a deadly brain tumor only found in children. She has been on a journey with Houston Methodist Hospital trying out a magnetic stimulation helmet which could possibly get rid of her tumor.

Just last week, ABC13's Mayra Moreno followed up with her and the team of doctors, and her results are astonishing.

Last October, ABC13 spoke to Stephanie Gonzalez as she was going through an experimental treatment using this very helmet.

""(I wear it) six hours a day,"" Gonzalez said. ""As soon as I wake up, I just do the helmet and it motivates me to keep going.""

Not long ago, she was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, which is an aggressive and malignant tumor found in the middle of the brainstem normally found in children.

""These tumors are like an octopus. They have a head and they have tentacles that expand long distances into the brain,"" Dr. David Baskin, the director of the Kenneth R. Peak Brain and Pituitary Treatment Center, said.

Dr. Baskin has spent his entire life treating people with tumors and said he has seen vital young people become quadriplegic, go on a ventilator, and worse.

""Most people are faced with this terrible decision of how long should you continue to live like this,"" Dr. Baskin said.

But this astonishing research with the oncomagentic helmet conducted by Dr. Baskin, his team at Houston Methodist, and research institute scientist Dr. Santosh Helekar is showing dramatic promise.

Is it possible that magnetic waves could kill cancerous cells?

So for the last half year, Gonzalez has been placing her hope on the helmet and her faith in her doctors. She was given specific instruction to wear the helmet six hours a day, every day.

""There was moments when I was getting frustrated, there was other things I would rather do versus sitting at home with the helmet or going outside having a big device,"" she said.

Still, she pressed on. Now for the first time, ABC13 got to see her results since our last interview.

""So here we are on September 7, 2022. You can see this pretty nasty tumor, and over months, we saw this thing get smaller and smaller and smaller."" Dr. Baskin pointed out. ""Here we are February 1, just a few weeks ago, you really can't see much of anything at all.""

It's a stunning miracle and the results are obvious.

""So it's an emotional moment for me to think, 'Wow, do we really have something this good?' Of course, it's only one patient, and maybe it's not going to work in every patient, but the fact that it worked in any patient is absolutely remarkable,"" Dr. Baskin said.

Gonzalez is the first person in the world with her type of tumor to try this kind of therapy under the FDA's program expanded access, which allows approved compassionate use for patients at the end-stage of cancer and have no other options.

""It's a mix of emotions. Excited, mainly excited,"" Gonzalez said.

It wasn't long ago that she was told there was nothing that could be done to get rid of this deadly tumor. However, she, her family, and especially her boyfriend, never gave up. After one night of searching online, he found an article about Dr. Baskin. With nothing to lose, Gonzalez found herself at Houston Methodist with Dr. Baskin and Dr. Helekar.

""I just want to say thank you. They never gave up. Even though a lot of the results were negative, they never gave up, and I think that's a really hopeful thing,"" Gonzalez said.

The next big goal is to head into a full clinical trial to give others like Gonzalez a fighting chance. But that will take millions of dollars.

For news updates, follow Mayra Moreno on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

For now, Gonzalez will continue using the helmet and focusing on her future. She's going to school for nursing and says her spirits have been high thanks to those around her.

""Definitely will say, have your support system. That will help you a lot having people to always motivate you, push you forward that always helps,"" she said."

Allergy season is in full swing. This can differ depend on where you live, but in general it refers to the time between early spring and late fall when different trees, grasses and weeds release pollen into the air.

Unfortunately, allergy season is now getting longer and worse, according to a new report released this month by Climate Central. Climate change is prompting plants to leaf and bloom earlier in many areas of the country, producing a longer and overall more intense period for those who deal with seasonal allergies to pollen and mold.

Climate Central examined growing seasons in the U.S. beginning in 1970, finding that the time between first and last freezes has lengthened an average of 15 days and by at least a month in 31 cities. Reno, Nevada, had one of the longest extensions, with an increase of 99 days. (See how your city stacks up among other “allergy capitals,” according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.)

“There have been several studies supporting that allergy seasons have now run longer with more intense and higher pollen counts due to climate change,” said Dr. Shuba Iyngar, co-founder and chief medical officer at Allermi. “The rising temperatures have resulted in changes to the pollination patterns, causing more intense as well as longer symptoms for people who suffer from pollen allergies.”

Some people experience itchy eyes while others might have to deal with a pesky runny nose or other frustrating symptoms. We spoke with two allergists about how to prepare for allergy season and what to look out for.

How do you know if you have seasonal allergies?

As with many common illnesses, symptoms can vary, but there are a few that are more prevalent.

“The most common symptoms that people have when they have seasonal allergies include nasal congestion, itchy eyes, itchy nose, runny nose,” Iyengar said.

She said people may also experience more frequent sinus infections and problems with snoring at night as a result of seasonal allergies.

Another lesser-known indication of seasonal allergies can be symptoms of asthma.

“People do not realize asthma is commonly triggered by seasonal allergies,” said Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist with the Allergy & Asthma Network. “Do not take breathing symptoms like coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath lightly.”

How can you prepare for allergy season?

For those with seasonal allergies, side effects of the pollen count and other irritants are pretty inevitable. However, Iyengar suggested a few preventative measures, including shutting bedroom windows to prevent pollen from coming in at night, frequently showering to get pollen off your body and taking your shoes off at the door to prevent tracking pollen into the home.

You may already have allergy medicine in the cabinet to take when symptoms arise, but Parikh recommended taking preventative allergy and asthma medications early. “Now is the ideal time to manage it easier, before symptoms get bad, rather than after.”

What’s the best treatment for seasonal allergies?

This best treatment option depends on the type of seasonal allergies you’re dealing with. However, Iyngar echoed something other allergy specialists have told HuffPost before: Nasal sprays are generally more effective for treating seasonal allergies.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 20:47:07,Why don’t we have vaccines for fungal infections?,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2023/2/11/23592955/last-of-us-fungal-vaccines-infections-cordyceps,Health,"The second episode of the HBO hit The Last Of Us opens with a scene in Jakarta, Indonesia. It’s set in 2003, at the beginning of a (fictional) fungal pandemic that goes on to destroy the world as we know it. After an expert in fungal biology evaluates the body of an infected factory worker, she speaks quietly to a military official who has asked for her help controlling the pathogen’s spread.

“There is no vaccine,” she says to his stricken face.

It was true in real-world 2003, and it’s true now: Although vaccines against bacterial and viral diseases abound, no vaccines against any fungal pathogens are licensed for human use. That’s particularly worrisome as real-world fungal threats make waves, most notably a massive recent rise in Candida auris, a yeast that causes life-threatening bloodstream infections in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients — and that’s increasingly resistant to anti-fungal treatments.

It’s not for lack of trying: Dennis Dixon, who leads bacterial and fungal research at the National Institutes of Health, said there’s been “continuous activity” aimed at developing fungal vaccines for decades. But a variety of challenges both scientific and economic have conscripted even more promising fungal vaccine candidates to the pharmacologic dustbin — to the detriment of human health.

The zombie-causing fungus in the show is mostly fictitious — at least, as a human pathogen. In reality, most severe fungal infections in humans affect immunocompromised people, including people with untreated HIV infection and those receiving cancer treatment, organ transplants, or medications for autoimmune diseases. (These usually manifest as lung and bloodstream infections or meningitis, and not zombification.)

However, some affect people with normal immune systems — ever had a yeast infection, or heard of valley fever? — and the global burden of fungal infections is expected to increase as the number of people receiving immunosuppressive drugs continues its upward climb and climate change accelerates.

The urgency of finding a vaccine to prevent any fungal infection — or ideally, preventing multiple types of fungal infections with one vaccine — is not new, but it’s growing.

Which raises the question: Why, in the year of our lord 2023, do we still not have any fungal vaccines? The answers highlight challenges in both the science and economics of vaccine development — and some idiosyncrasies about a kingdom of life already known for its very specific (and highly telegenic) weirdness.

A fungal vaccine would help prevent a lot of infections

Fungi are all around us: in the air we breathe, on the surfaces we touch, and all over the insides and the outsides of our bodies. Still, most of us are at low risk for fungal infections, as long as our immune systems are functioning normally.

The worst fungal infection likely to affect a person with a healthy immune system is probably one caused by a member of the Candida genus, which are technically yeasts (yes, yeasts are a type of fungus, as are mushrooms and molds). Vaginal yeast infections are an especially common form of candidal infection that often affects healthy people, leading to 1.4 million clinic visits a year in the US alone. Worldwide, an estimated 138 million women get four or more yeast infections a year. Other fungal infections common to healthy people include ringworm — which, surprise! isn’t caused by a worm at all — and infections of the nails on fingers or toes.

But fungal infections (including and beyond yeast infections) are a much bigger threat to people with compromised immune systems. Worldwide, fungi cause 13 million infections and 1.5 million deaths every year. And in 2018, treating these infections cost Americans nearly $7 billion.

Fungal infections are most common in immunosuppressed people. That complicates developing and deploying fungal vaccines.

The fact that the most severe fungal infections primarily affect immunosuppressed people creates some big challenges when it comes to developing vaccines to protect against them.

First of all, this makes it complicated to find participants for clinical trials testing fungal vaccines.

To determine whether a vaccine works, scientists need to test promising vaccine candidates — usually, prototypes that have successfully prevented the disease in experimentally infected animals —in large groups of humans. Because we live in a world with medical ethics, scientists can’t experimentally infect humans. Instead, they need to wait for people in the trial to naturally encounter the disease they’re trying to prevent.

The more rare that disease, the more people scientists need to follow (and for a longer time) to look for the disease. And while severe fungal infections are a growing problem, they’re still relatively uncommon.

Karen Norris, an immunologist at the University of Georgia’s veterinary school who leads a team developing a fungal vaccine candidate, said her team had “done the math” on the time it would take to study a hypothetical vaccine targeting a single fungal infection. “It’s doable, but it would take a couple of years to enroll that many patients,” she said.

It’s also hard to design vaccines that work for the immunocompromised people who need them the most. An effective vaccine works by training a person’s immune system to respond quickly to a certain germ — and suppressed immune systems are hard to safely train.

In some cases, it’s possible to predict immunosuppression — for example, when a person is preparing to receive chemotherapy or another immunosuppressive treatment. But not always: People with HIV and those who are born with immune system disorders can’t plan or predict the state of their immune systems.

That creates big challenges for scientists, who ideally want to develop vaccines that protect both people with healthy immune systems who go on to have immunosuppression, and those whose first diagnosis involves immunosuppression.

Another problem: Fungal cells have more similarities to human cells than do viruses or bacteria. That makes it more complicated to design a vaccine that trains the immune system to attack fungal cells without attacking our own cells.

The biggest barrier to fungal vaccines might be economic

Even if a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials, that doesn’t mean it will get to mass production and market: For that, it also needs to have the potential to make a profit. “The testing of a vaccine in this space is, to be honest, not that attractive to big pharma, etc., because they are not infections that occur at a high frequency in a lot of patients,” said Norris.

Even if a vaccine prevents a lot of illness and death in a group of people — and reduces the costs of their medical care — those benefits accrue to individuals and health care systems, not to the pharmaceutical companies who incur the costs of developing and producing the vaccine.

“It’s going to take someone to develop that tough market for this to go forward,” said Dixon. A viable vaccine will need to not only be effective at preventing disease, but effective at doing so in enough people to make producing the vaccine at scale a worthwhile investment for pharmaceutical companies.

Still, people are working on fungal vaccines, and there are a few promising candidates

Regardless of the obstacles, people are working to develop fungal vaccines — and have been for decades.

To overcome the economic inviability of developing vaccines that prevent only a small number of infections, several scientists are developing vaccines that prevent multiple fungal infections — or better yet, all of them.

Norris’s group has developed a prototype targeting three fungi responsible for 80 percent of all infections in immunocompromised people: Candida, Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis. The prototype significantly reduced illness and deaths due to these infections in experimental mice and primates. A wide variety of other candidates are also being studied.

Three fungal vaccines have made it into the human clinical trial stage to date. In the early 1980s, a trial of a vaccine to prevent infections with Coccidioides — the fungus that causes valley fever — didn’t reduce infections, and produced lots of side effects. More recently, two vaccines aimed at preventing Candida (i.e., yeast) infections had good results in human safety trials, one of which looked to be effective at preventing recurrent vaginal infections in a small, placebo-controlled trial. But without an investor to take testing to the next level — a clinical trial comparing the vaccine to standard preventive therapy — development stalled out, said Dixon.

That’s particularly regrettable because that vaccine, called NDV-3A, showed promise of preventing Candida auris, which the Centers for Disease Control and Protection now reports is rising at alarming rates. People at risk for infections with this germ are those who are already severely ill or have invasive medical devices (like dialysis catheters). The CDC recently published data indicating a threefold increase in both the overall number of cases between 2019 and 2021, and in the proportion of cases that were drug-resistant.

In animal trials, NDV-3A reduced Candida auris’s disease-causing activity, augmented the immune system’s response to it, and enhanced the protectiveness of drugs to which the yeast is often resistant. However, human trials of the vaccine against this emerging threat never materialized.

Norris said additional animal safety studies of her team’s prototype could take another year. If those go well, the next step — a safety trial in humans — would also take about a year. After that, at least several more years of work await before her team has a licensed vaccine produced at scale.

So while any progress on fungal vaccines feels momentous, it’s wise to stay grounded about the timeline of progress in this space, said Dixon. “It’s certainly going to be a while to figure out how to get the science right, to get the protection right,” he said, “and get to the goal line.”

Update, March 24, 4:50 pm ET: This story was originally published on February 11 and has been updated to reflect recently published CDC data on Candida auris and the promise of one vaccine candidate against the pathogen in animal trials."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 19:55:16,Tulane receives up to $16 million to move nasal pneumonia vaccine from the lab to clinical trials,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230324/Tulane-receives-up-to-2416-million-to-move-nasal-pneumonia-vaccine-from-the-lab-to-clinical-trials.aspx,Health,"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded an up to $16 million contract to Tulane University to bring to phase one clinical trial a nasal spray vaccine university researchers invented to thwart antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, a leading cause of pneumonia.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are on the rise and are a significant cause of infections requiring hospitalization among children and the elderly. As doctors try to find new types of antibiotics to fight these so-called superbugs, Tulane University School of Medicine researchers Elizabeth Norton, PhD, and Jay Kolls, MD, inventors of the vaccine, are working to protect people before they are exposed to the pathogens in the first place.

""Multidrug-resistant bacteria are causing more severe infections and are a growing public health threat. Vaccines targeting these pathogens represent the most cost-effective option, particularly if you can use this vaccine to prevent or treat the infection in high-risk individuals,"" said Norton, principal investigator and associate professor of microbiology and immunology. ""Right now, there is no vaccine on the market that targets this type of pneumonia.""

Klebsiella pneumoniae is the third leading cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia and the second leading cause of bloodstream infections with the highest incidence of serious infections. It is also a major cause of childhood pneumonia in parts of Asia. The Tulane vaccine would target high-risk populations such as immunocompromised individuals, diabetics or organ transplant recipients.

Norton said that while the vaccine targets the Klebsiella bacteria, its unique design gives it the potential to be cross-reactive to other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, the antibiotic-resistant bacterial species behind many hospital-acquired infections, including E. coli.

The vaccine, called CladeVax, is designed to efficiently target mucosa in the nose, throat and lungs to protect the area most at risk for infection.

The nasal spray vaccine uses an adjuvant -; a compound that stimulates the immune system -; named LTA1 that Norton developed at Tulane. That adjuvant, which is made using a protein derived from the E. coli bacteria, will be combined with a series of proprietary antigens identified by the Kolls lab that include outer membrane proteins from the target bacteria.

This is an entirely novel vaccine platform, from the use of the adjuvant to the needle-less route of administration. This represents an entirely new class of vaccines for bacteria that elicits protection in two ways -; both antibody and T-cell immunity. All current pneumonia vaccines only elicit antibodies against surface carbohydrates. Our platform has the potential advantage of providing a much broader protection against pneumonia."" Jay Kolls, co-principal investigator, and the John W. Deming Endowed Chair in Internal Medicine

Tulane researchers will first test vaccine formulations in animal models and nonhuman primates for dosing and safety before advancing to clinical trials. The project will include collaborators at Tulane National Primate Research Center, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane Clinical Translational Unit, and the University of North Carolina as well as contractors for GMP manufacturing.

""If this succeeds, we will have another arsenal for the growing number of antibiotic resistant sources of pneumonia or bloodstream infections,"" Norton said. ""And we can hopefully expand this nasal spray delivery platform to other infections, working on a single, combination vaccine that is needle-less and targets several organisms at once."""
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 19:49:39,TTUHSC El Paso scientist receives $2.6 million NIH grant for research on tuberculosis,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230324/TTUHSC-El-Paso-scientist-receives-2426-million-NIH-grant-for-research-on-tuberculosis.aspx,Health,"For over a century, El Paso has long been a sanctuary for individuals suffering from tuberculosis. It will soon be home to groundbreaking research that prevents the debilitating disease. Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso infectious disease researcher Subramanian Dhandayuthapani, Ph.D., has been awarded a $2.6 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to investigate tuberculosis. The announcement was made ahead of World Tuberculosis Day, which is recognized every year on March 24.

Known as Dr. Pani on campus, the researcher's five-year grant will explore developing new vaccines to prevent tuberculosis, which affects over 10 million people worldwide each year.

We're incredibly proud of Dr. Pani's remarkable achievement in being awarded the NIH R01 grant for his research on tuberculosis. This transformational grant will support Dr. Pani and his team's revolutionary work to improve our understanding of this infectious disease and develop new, preventive vaccines for tuberculosis. The impact of this research will address health disparities in the underserved communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. We look forward to the progress his research will bring to our Borderplex community and beyond."" Richard Lange, M.D., M.B.A., TTUHSC El Paso President

The oldest and most widely sought-after source of funding at the NIH, R01 grant applications are highly competitive. The success rate is as low as 10%, meaning that only a fraction of applicants are successful in obtaining funding. As a testament to their importance, R01 grants often establish a framework for best practices or standards of care within the health care profession.

Tuberculosis, a highly contagious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affects the lungs. It's a major public health concern, with the World Health Organization ranking it as the 13th leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent, with 10.6 million men, women and children afflicted by the disease. The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains has made the treatment even more challenging, emphasizing the need for new drugs and therapies.

Tuberculosis is a serious public health issue in El Paso County and in underserved communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the incidence rate of tuberculosis in El Paso County in 2020 was 2.7 cases per 100,000 people, which is higher than the state average of 1.9 cases per 100,000 people and the national average of 2.3 cases per 100,000 people. The incidence rate of tuberculosis in Texas border counties was 2.8 cases per 100,000 people in 2020.

Working in collaboration with Shrikanth Gadad, Ph.D., M.Sc., and Jessica Chacon, Ph.D., from TTUHSC El Paso and Chinnaswamy Jagannath, Ph.D., from Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Dr. Pani's work will leverage the latest advances in genomics, immunology and bioinformatics. Their focus is on the development of improved new-generation BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccines. These serums contain a weakened strain of the bacteria Mycobacterium bovis, which is related to the bacteria that cause human tuberculosis. When administered, the vaccine stimulates the immune system to recognize and fight off similar bacteria in the future, thus providing protection against tuberculosis infection.

This is the second grant Dr. Pani has received from the NIH for research in this area. His first, a $492,258 grant from the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was awarded in 2021.

""Our research on tuberculosis vaccine development is not only about finding new treatments but also improving health outcomes for patients around the world,"" said Dr. Pani. ""By identifying new targets and developing new treatments, we can help alleviate the burden of this disease. I'm honored to receive this NIH R01 grant, and excited about the potential impact our research could have on preventing this disease.""

Dr. Pani is also a professor with TTUHSC El Paso's Center of Emphasis for Infectious Diseases within the Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine. The Center provides critical resources and expertise to support Dr. Pani's work, including access to patient populations and advanced research technologies. In turn, his research also contributes to the center's broader mission of addressing health disparities and improving health outcomes for Hispanics in the region.

Collaboration among the Centers of Emphasis and with other institutions, community organizations and stakeholders is essential in addressing the complex health issues faced by Hispanics in the region. By working together, researchers develop innovative approaches to health care that make a significant impact on the health of the community. Through shared commitment to improving health equity and outcomes, TTUHSC El Paso's Centers of Emphasis demonstrate the power of collaboration in achieving meaningful progress in addressing health disparities and improving the lives of those we serve.

The new vaccine has the potential to protect against other viral infections – it's designed to work in a nonspecific manner, which means it helps the immune system fight off any viruses it encounters. This is an exciting development because it means the vaccine could have a broader impact on public health beyond just tuberculosis prevention.

Moreover, the vaccine has shown potential in treating bladder cancer. Researchers have discovered the vaccine can stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells in the bladder. This is significant because bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S., and current treatments can have debilitating side effects. If the vaccine is successful in clinical trials, it could provide a more effective and less invasive treatment option for bladder cancer patients.

The Borderplex region, which spans across West Texas, Southern New Mexico, and Northern Mexico, is home to a large number of individuals who are at risk of developing tuberculosis due to high rates of poverty, migration and other factors. The funding of Dr. Pani's research will not only benefit this community, but also contribute to the global effort to combat tuberculosis and improve the health of populations worldwide.

Students attending TTUHSC El Paso will have the unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience by working on the project alongside Dr. Pani and his team. While the grant is fully dedicated to research, students from the Foster School of Medicine and the Francis Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences will still have the chance to participate. The opportunity to work on such an impactful project is invaluable for students looking to further their education and careers in the medical field.

After three years, Los Angeles County’s COVID emergency will end on March 31. Here’s what is changing in L.A. County.

Rent protections expire

The county Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal on Tuesday intended to soften the blow for renters who could soon face eviction. L.A. County’s COVID-19 emergency tenant regulations have given low-income tenants protections in eviction court if they can’t pay rent on time due to economic harms brought on by the pandemic. But those tenants will have to pay their April rent on time — or face eviction.

Health changes

The move triggers a review of local public health officer orders which were put in place under the emergency authorization. The L.A. County Department of Public Health, Health Services and the Department of Social Services must complete the review by the end of March . The departments will report back to the board with a list of orders still in play, such as mobile vaccine vans.

From a patient perspective, you won’t see drastic changes after the COVID health emergency expires in L.A. County. California’s state COVID emergency ended February 28, and the federal emergencies are still in play until May 11. Instead, it marks a shift toward treating COVID like other communicable diseases and moving intervention measures to individuals and their healthcare providers.

Vaccines will remain widely available and COVID testing will be provided at public health sites. Public Health will also “continue to use its long standing non-emergency state law communicable disease control authority to take measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” according to a statement by the department.

“This includes continuing to require that individuals infected with COVID isolate themselves from others for a minimum of five days, requiring businesses and schools to report COVID case clusters to DPH, and requiring healthcare workers be vaccinated and wear masks when providing patient care and when they’re in patient care areas,” the statement adds.

Health workers must keep masks on

All three health departments in L.A. County will keep a COVID mask mandate in place for all health workers when they are around patients. The move is more restrictive than the state, which will roll back both rules April 3.

Visitors and patients will no longer be required to wear a mask. Masks won’t disappear in all medical offices. Even without the state requirement, individual clinics and hospitals in California can require their staff to wear masks at their own discretion.

Pasadena Public Health Department along with the City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services will join L.A. County Public Health in keeping the masking policy. It will be reassessed by September 2023, depending on federal health guidance.

The county’s emergency order that allowed restaurants to expand seating onto public walkways and parking lots is expiring March 31. But if your restaurant is in an unincorporated area of the county and you currently have a permit, you can keep the extra tables out.

The permit has been extended to Jan. 1, 2024 for existing permit holders while the county develops a permanent outdoor dining program. If your restaurant is in one of the county’s 88 cities, you’ll need to check with your local jurisdiction."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 19:28:34,Substance use disorders not associated with COVID-19-related mortality,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230324/Substance-use-disorders-not-associated-with-COVID-19-related-mortality.aspx,Health,"New research from Boston Medical Center found that substance use disorders do not increase the likelihood of dying from COVID-19. Published in Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment, the study showed that the increased risk for severe COVID-19 in people with SUD that has been seen may be the result of co-occurring medical conditions.

Multiple large cohort studies from early in the pandemic have shown higher rates of hospitalization, intubation, and death from COVID-19 in those with SUD, while other studies found no association between SUD and COVID-19-related mortality or mixed results depending on substance use pattern. Given these conflicting data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified persons with SUD as suggestive of higher risk for severe COVID-19. The goal of this study was to assess the association between SUD and inpatient COVID-19-related mortality.

BMC is known for excellent clinical care and innovative research related to substance use disorder. Since the early days of the pandemic, BMC has also been a leader in the treatment of individuals with COVID-19, including persons with complex medical and social needs. These findings showing a similar likelihood of COVID-19-related complications in hospitalized patients with and without SUD helps expand knowledge of the infectious complications of SUD."" Angela McLaughlin, MD, MPH, first author, infectious disease fellow at Boston Medical Center

As BMC sees a high proportion of patients who use substances, it was an apt location for the study: almost 14% of the study population had SUD, exceeding the national average of 10.8% in people ages 18 or older. Researchers reviewed medical records of 353 adults without SUD and 56 adults with SUD admitted to Boston Medical Center early into COVID-19 pandemic and compared the likelihood of COVID-19 related complications between individuals with and without substance use disorders. They compared the relationship between COVID-19 and mortality, clinical complications, and resource utilization.

""Early in the pandemic, BMC developed protocols to closely monitor and quickly manage COVID-19-related complications in all hospitalized patients,"" said senior author Sabrina Assoumou, MD, MPH, an infectious disease doctor at Boston Medical Center and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. ""The current findings suggest that such an approach might have benefited many patients, including individuals with substance use disorders.""

In this retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to a safety net hospital during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, SUD was not associated with the primary outcome of COVID-19-associated inpatient mortality. The secondary analysis showed that those with and without SUD had similar COVID-19-related clinical complications, including secondary infections, renal failure requiring dialysis, acute liver injury, venous thromboembolism, cardiac complications, and the composite ""any complications."" Of note, some clinical outcomes such as stroke were very uncommon overall. Likewise, there was no difference in resource utilization secondary outcomes between the two groups. In contrast to other studies, this found similar likelihoods of mechanical ventilation and ICU admission in patients with and without SUD. Although patients with SUD presented to the hospital earlier in their disease course, their total hospital length of stay was ultimately similar to patients without SUD. Insights such as these into the clinical complications and resource utilization patterns of patients with SUD and COVID-19 can help clinicians anticipate the trajectory of infection and healthcare needs in this vulnerable group.

There were some notable limitations to the study. The results are from a single site, which might limit generalizability of the findings despite the racial and ethnic diversity of the BMC patient population. Second, the data presented are from the earliest phase of COVID-19 in the United States, so trends may have differed with subsequent waves and as COVID-19 management strategies have evolved over time. Third, there were no specific controls for socioeconomic factors like medical insurance status or income level, as over 75% of the BMC patient population has public payer insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, or Children's Health Insurance Program) or no insurance. Lastly, differences in COVID-19 outcomes between current versus past SUD could not be detected – this area would benefit from further research.

In conclusion, in this study of hospitalized individuals at an urban safety net hospital with a diverse patient population in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, inpatient mortality and morbidity between patients with and without SUD were similar. The findings provide a detailed evaluation of outcomes in a unique patient population that has been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and may provide beneficial insights for similar settings across the country. These results point away from SUD as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 and further suggest a focus on medical comorbidities to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate for differential outcomes in this high-risk population, particularly in an era of newer COVID-19-directed therapies."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 17:23:00,Obamacare at 13: Biden and a KHN reporter remember,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230324/Obamacare-At-13-Biden-And-A-KHN-Reporter-Remember.aspx,Health,"I was back in the crowded East Room of the White House on Thursday, as I was 13 years ago, this time standing under a portrait of first first lady Martha Washington, when President Joe Biden entered for a lunchtime event focused on the Affordable Care Act.

The room looked much the same as it did on March 23, 2010, when I had rushed over to the White House to witness President Barack Obama signing his historic health bill into law. I knew from that moment — standing under a portrait of President Teddy Roosevelt, who was the first chief executive to espouse a need for national health insurance — that my life as a health journalist would never be the same.

Yet, when Biden scheduled an event to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the health law, I was unsure of the need to keep commemorating its birthday.

After all, on the 13th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson signing Medicare and Medicaid into law — July 30, 1978 — the Democratic president in the White House did not hold an event to commemorate the date when tens of millions of older Americans and lower-income people gained coverage. Then-President Jimmy Carter spent that Sunday at Camp David.

But with the ACA in 2010, after a century of debate, the U.S. health system was getting hit with a thunderbolt that would enable millions of people to gain medical coverage. The law made many changes affecting hospitals, doctors, insurers, drugmakers, and employers in an effort to live up to its lofty name by lowering costs.

Those sweeping provisions, the years spent implementing them, and efforts by Republicans and the courts to repeal or change the law have kept the Affordable Care Act in the news for even longer than I had anticipated. After 13 years, the job is still not done. North Carolina on Thursday became the 40th state to expand Medicaid under the ACA.

Biden used the health law anniversary to tout the law's influence. He reminded his audience that Republicans still want to strip many of its benefits. He also stressed that the country has unfinished business to lower drug costs for many and expand health coverage to people who still don't have it. Indeed, more than 2 million people are without coverage in the 10 states — highly populous Florida and Texas among them — that have yet to expand Medicaid.

Many former Obama staffers who helped get the law passed were there — including some who work in the Biden White House. (Obama was not there.) So, too, were several Democratic lawmakers who helped pass the law, including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and former California congressman and now Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.

""Look, 13 years ago today, we gathered in this room as President Obama signed into law the Affordable Health Care Act,"" Biden began with his remarks. ""Hard to believe 13 days ag- — 13 years ago. It seems like 13 days ago.""

""And I remember the three words I used at the time,"" he said as many in the audience recalled the swear word he was caught whispering to Obama via a live microphone. ""I thought it was. I thought it was a big deal. And I stand by the fact it was a big deal.""

Biden said that the health law has been called by many names, but that the most appropriate is Obamacare.

The law has become ingrained into the fabric of the country, Biden said. Over 40 million Americans are covered by Medicaid or online insurance marketplace plans, the highest on record, the Biden administration said Thursday. That's a 36% increase from 2021.

But a 13th anniversary celebration? Jessica Altman, who helped implement Obamacare in the Obama administration and is now CEO of Covered California, one of the Obamacare exchanges, said it was important to take time to remind people what the American health system used to look like as well as the many challenges remaining to improve it. (Altman is the daughter of KFF's president and CEO. KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)

“We still have places to go, and we still have work to do and the people in that room are excited to keep doing it,"" Altman said."

CNN —

The eyes are more than a window to the soul — they’re also a reflection of a person’s cognitive health.

“The eye is the window into the brain,” said ophthalmologist Dr. Christine Greer, director of medical education at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. “You can see directly into the nervous system by looking into the back of the eye, toward the optic nerve and retina.”

One day doctors may be able to use eye tests to identify cognitive decline soon after it begins. Getty Images

Research has been exploring how the eye may help in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease before symptoms begin. The disease is well advanced by the time memory and behavior are affected.

“Alzheimer’s disease begins in the brain decades before the first symptoms of memory loss,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, an Alzheimer’s preventive neurologist who is also at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases.

If doctors are able to identify the disease in its earliest stages, people could then make healthy lifestyle choices and control their “modifiable risk factors, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes,” Isaacson said,

The eye knows

Just how early can we see signs of cognitive decline? To find out, a recent study examined donated tissue from the retina and brains of 86 people with different degrees of mental decline.

“Our study is the first to provide in-depth analyses of the protein profiles and the molecular, cellular, and structural effects of Alzheimer’s disease in the human retina and how they correspond with changes in the brain and cognitive function,” said senior author Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, a professor of neurosurgery and biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, in a statement.

“These changes in the retina correlated with changes in parts of the brain called the entorhinal and temporal cortices, a hub for memory, navigation and the perception of time,” Koronyo-Hamaoui said.

Investigators in the study collected retinal and brain tissue samples over 14 years from 86 human donors with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment — the largest group of retinal samples ever studied, according to the authors.

Researchers then compared samples from donors with normal cognitive function to those with mild cognitive impairment and those with later-stage Alzheimer’s disease.

The study, published in February in the journal Acta Neuropathologica, found significant increases in beta-amyloid, a key marker of Alzheimer’s disease, in people with both Alzheimer’s and early cognitive decline.

Microglial cells declined by 80% in those with cognitive issues, the study found. These cells are responsible for repairing and maintaining other cells, including clearing beta-amyloid from the brain and retina.

“Markers of inflammation were (also) found, which may be an equally important marker for disease progression,” said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study.

“The findings were also apparent in people with no or minimal cognitive symptoms, which suggests these new eye tests may be well-positioned to aid in early diagnosis.”

The study researchers found higher numbers of immune cells tightly surrounding amyloid beta plaques as well as other cells responsible for inflammation and cell and tissue death.

Tissue atrophy and inflammation in cells in the far periphery of the retina were most predictive of cognitive status, the study found.

“These findings may eventually lead to the development of imaging techniques that allow us to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease earlier and more accurately,” Isaacson said, “and monitor its progression noninvasively by looking through the eye.”"
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 13:00:00,"For Those With Eating Disorders, Ozempic Can Be A Triggering Nightmare",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/conversations-about-ozempic-can-be-triggering-for-people-with-eating-disorders_l_64120b44e4b0cfde25c28551,Entertainment,"Illustration:Jianan Liu/HuffPost Photo:Getty Images

The nonstop TV ads for Ozempic ― a diabetes medication that has off-label use as a weight loss drug ― are plenty annoying: “Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic!” the unnervingly upbeat TV spot goes, sampling the 1970s classic-rock hit “Magic.”

For some people who’ve dealt with eating disorders, the TV spots ― along with suspected celebrity use and media coverage that some feel glamorize the drug ― aren’t merely annoying; it’s all been emotionally triggering. In some cases, talk of Ozempic is pushing those in recovery one step closer to relapse.

“The ease and availability of both Ozempic and Wegovy have given me pause and made me doubt my recovery journey,” said Becca, a 26-year-old from Ontario, Canada, who’s suffered from disordered eating for years.

Ozempic is part of an expanding, groundbreaking class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists that were first introduced as a diabetes treatment in 2017. Soon, it was discovered that the prescription injections also led to significant weight loss in people with obesity. That’s because GLP-1 slows down digestion and reduces food intake.

The FDA approved semaglutide, the active ingredient Ozempic, for weight loss in 2021 under the brand name Wegovy. “This is the first time ever that we have really effective drugs to treat obesity,” one bariatric surgeon told HuffPost earlier this year of the “game-changing” drug.

In a year-end earning call a few months ago, Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer that produces both drugs, reportedly cited worldwide market growth of 50%, with almost 40,000 new Wegovy prescriptions being written every week.

Now some folks who seemingly don’t need the drug for their health ― including celebrities ― have discovered Ozempic and Wegovy. It’s not terribly hard to find doctors, nurse practitioners or medi-spas willing to prescribe both for off-label use. That’s all perfectly legal, though not generally advised.

That development is disheartening for Becca. After a year of working with a therapist and body-neutral trainer to set body goals tied to strength and weight training rather than weight loss, Ozempic is giving her pause.

“The existence of drugs like Ozempic have me thinking, what would my life be like if I could simply avail of these meds?” said Becca, who, like many in this story, asked to use her first name only to protect her privacy. “What would it feel like to fit into specific styles of clothing?” she said. “What sort of ego boost will I get from people praising my weight loss?”

“The existence of drugs like Ozempic have me thinking, what would my life be like if I could simply avail of these meds?” - Becca, 26

It’s the secrecy around Ozempic that bothers Becca most. Gossip accounts on Instagram like DeuxMoi debate which celebs they suspect are taking the weight-loss darling drug. Some celebrities, like Chelsea Handler and Elon Musk, have admitted to using it.

Most stars have remained silent on the rumors, though a few have expressly denied using it, including Khloé Kardashian and “Real Housewives” cast member Kyle Richards. (The medication is a big talking point lately among the “Real Housewives” set and their fans; Jackie Goldschneider, who is recovering from anorexia and a star of the New Jersey iteration of the show, slammed the medication as “an eating disorder in a needle.”)

“When celebrities deny and tout their weight loss journey and point to diets and exercise when they are availing of medication, it’s not only disingenuous but also massively fucked up,” Becca said.

It doesn’t help that the dialogue around Ozempic just so happens to dovetail with the dialogue about buccal fat removal and the dialogue around Gwyneth Paltrow’s highly restrictive “daily wellness” diet that seems more dangerous than nourishing.

All of it speaks to our cultural fear of being fat, said Aaron Flores, a registered dietitian and nutritionist in Calabasas, California.

“It’s a reflection of how deep the fear of weight gain and existing in a large body truly is in our society,” he said. “The message being sent is very clear; being in a large body is bad and you should do anything possible to change it.”

The way this medication has become trendy and in demand also speaks to the deep disparity that exists in health care, Flores said. (Ozempic retails for about $900 a month if your insurance doesn’t cover it.)

The popularity of the drug has led to a national shortage, making obtaining it difficult for diabetics who use Ozempic to manage their blood sugar and reduce their risk of heart problems and other complications.

“But if you have the financial privilege to go outside of your insurance coverage, you can find someone to prescribe this drug to you, no problem,” Flores said. “Large groups of people who take this for its intended purpose are going to be denied access to this intervention, only because others with more privilege and more money can circumvent the system.”

PixelsEffect via Getty Images Diabetics may need Ozempic to manage their blood sugar and reduce their risk of heart problems and other complications, but it's increasingly being prescribed for off-label use.

It should be noted: Ozempic comes with some pretty gnarly side effects. Anecdotally, Flores said that his clients who’ve taken this and other medications like it have struggled with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation. Still, even knowing all that, the allure of being skinny via a simple needle jab is strong.

Candice Coppola, a 41-year-old business coach who’s struggled with bulimia in the past, has had to temporarily stop herself from scrolling on Instagram, given how many people she follows who she suspects are taking Ozempic.

“These are people I otherwise very much enjoy,” she said. “It concerns me seeing this rapid weight loss of other people, 35 pounds in three weeks.”

Coppola, who hosts the “Power in Purpose” podcast and lives in Connecticut, said there have been times in the last month when she’s paused and thought: Maybe I could find somebody to prescribe the drug to me. Maybe I could be a little thinner.

“I’ve had to remind myself of how far I’ve come and that it’s not necessarily about fitness, it’s about how you feel, and I feel good so why would I feel like I need to do that?” she said.

It’s helped Coppola to talk about her worries, especially with her husband, who is diabetic.

Abby Rose Morris, a 26-year-old actor from New York who experienced periods of extreme calorie restriction in middle school and high school, is worried that the normalization of off-label Ozempic prescriptions will put even more pressure on women to lose weight.

“With these drugs available, fatness is starting to be viewed as a conscious choice not to take the ‘easy’ solution that would spare people from all the discrimination and harassment that comes with living in a larger body,” she told HuffPost.

“I’ve worked very hard to heal my relationship with food, and going on a medication that can take away hunger or make eating difficult could definitely jeopardize that,” she said.

Maskot via Getty Images ""Drug like this clearly do not treat the root cause of eating disorders,” said Brittany Burgunder, a certified professional life coach and eating disorder specialist. “Instead, it places a temporary bandage on internal woes until it no longer works, resulting in a recipe for relapse.”

Culturally, Morris thinks we’ve pathologized the desire for food, something we need to survive. “Feeling liberated from your hunger cues is not normal,” she wrote in a viral tweet earlier this month. “Sure, use Ozempic for medical reasons, but being hungry is not a disease.”

Some people online have said that conversations around Ozempic and eating disorders need to be more nuanced ― “please kindly understand there is more than one eating disorder, and Ozempic is life changing for binge eating disorder,” one woman tweeted.

While this can be true and valid, the experts we spoke to worry that some might look at Ozempic as a solve-all for something complex like binge eating. Yes, it’s an eating disorder, but it’s also a complex mental health condition that isn’t just about food intake.

“Weight loss drugs may result in changes in weight but do not address the emotional and psychological aspects that contribute to disordered eating. Weight loss will not ‘cure’ an eating disorder,” said Ashley Moser, a clinical education specialist at the Renfrew Center, an eating disorder treatment program in Philadelphia.

“Many, many people are invested in you hating your body ― it lines their pockets.” - Jessica Sprengle, licensed professional therapist who specializes in eating disorders

In fact, while eating disorders often do not have a single identifiable cause, Moser said many people who develop eating disorders report dieting as a precursor. Plus, Moser noted, once someone stops taking a medication, the preexisting issues return: their blood sugar rises, their cravings come back and they often regain weight. This is why most people who take the drug typically use it long term for maintenance as well.

Model and size-inclusivity advocate Remi Bader recently admitted she’d been prescribed Ozempic because she was pre-diabetic. After going off the medication, she “gained double the weight back” and her eating disorder resurfaced.

“Drug[s] like this clearly do not treat the root cause of eating disorders,” said Brittany Burgunder, a certified professional life coach and eating disorder specialist. “Instead, it places a temporary bandage on internal woes until it no longer works, resulting in a recipe for relapse.”

But if you have an eating disorder ― no matter which one ― and see others achieving desired results with the use of a single drug, “it becomes a much more alluring route to follow versus doing the long, tedious and challenging work that is required of long-term recovery,” Burgunder said.

RealPeopleGroup via Getty Images Be cautious about the hype of another diet culture cycle in action.

If talk of Ozempic as an easy path to weight loss is triggering you, we asked eating disorder specialists ― and people who are in recovery ― to share the advice they’d give to anyone who’s struggling right now.

Be cautious about the hype.

Be cautious about the information that you read online, since not all sources are reputable or accurate. While it can be tempting to believe losing weight will solve your problems, especially when it feels like everyone but you is using Ozempic, remember that taking the drug is not worth losing your progress over, Burgunder said.

“This drug has yet to be systematically tested in those with body weights that fall outside of the FDA’s criteria and either way, more often than not, turning to quick fixes backfire[s] in far greater ways, both physically and mentally,” Burgunder said.

Remember that the diet industry is a 70 billion dollar industry that has a lot to gain from your buy-in, said Jessica Sprengle, a licensed professional therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders.

“It’s geared toward making sure you hate your body enough to do anything in your power to change it,” she said. “Many, many people are invested in you hating your body ― it lines their pockets ― and they will do everything imaginable, including marketing drugs like these, even if they’re dangerous, to make money.”

The pressure to buy in to quick fixes may even come from your doctor. As noted in a recent New Yorker piece on Ozempic, doctors “frequently misdiagnose, undertreat, or shame fat people, who then accumulate reasons to distrust medical care.” A 2012 survey of almost 2,500 U.S. women found that 69% reported feeling stigmatized for their weight and 52% endured recurring fat bias by their doctors.

Karl Tapales via Getty Images “Seeking professional support in navigating systemic diet culture messages is important,” said Ashley Moser, a clinical education specialist at the Renfrew Center.

Mute words and phrases that trigger you on social media.

If you’re extremely online (or even just semi-online), it’s near impossible to escape articles and gossip items about celebrities (and non-celebs with money) using Ozempic for off-label use.

Thankfully, you can mute the words “Ozempic” and “Wegovy” from showing up on your Twitter, Instagram and TikTok.

If your YouTube feed is wall-to-wall Ozempic trend videos because you watched a clip or two and now the algorithm thinks you’re interested, remove individual videos from your watch history. That alone may reduce the chance of similar recommendations in the future. (It also might help to remove individual searches from your search history.)

Start following body-neutral influencers and writers.

Time and time again, body neutrality experts we’ve spoken to recommend curating your social media feeds to omit Influencers and Instagram accounts that bring you down. (Think “fitspiration” and diet-centric content, or anyone who’s more subtly pushing the need to slim down.)

Coppola said that this small step has had a huge impact on her recovery journey.

“It really does help to just liberally remove people from your social media feed and from your social media world who trigger you, who bring up these thoughts and who are beginning to rewire your old habits, routines, rituals, and ways of thinking,” she said.

In their place, diversify your following list to include dietitians and mid-size and plus-size content creators who value body acceptance and neutrality.

“I follow a ton of anti-diet dietitians who remind me regularly that being hungry is OK and normal,” Morris said. “Outside of carefully curating your social media feeds, I just have to keep going back to the books and articles and podcasts that convinced me to stop dieting.”

Sprengle suggests reading content that more holistically discusses the harm these drugs can cause and how we’ve gotten here, like Marquisele Mercedes’ piece on Wegovy from 2021.

Carlina Teteris via Getty Images If online conversations are complicating your recovery, mute words and phrases that trigger you on social media.

Get outside help and talk about it.

People in recovery are always encouraged to talk with people they trust about how exposure to certain headlines impacts them.

“Expressing how you feel to people who understand has a way of defusing the emotions that are activated by exposure,” Moser said. “Seeking professional support in navigating systemic diet culture messages is important while also receiving specialized help from therapists, dietitians and physicians.”

Remember how far you’ve come in your recovery process.

When Morris goes down a rabbit hole of reading about Ozempic or similar treatments, she tries to think of the big picture, she said. Will this matter in 10 years?

“I know many of us have regrets about the experiences we’ve missed out on because we were so worried about food or what our bodies looked like, so thinking of it in terms of your past is helpful, too,” she said.

“It also really helps me to think that humans evolved to need and enjoy food,” Morris said. “It’s natural, it’s normal to be hungry. That’s your body trying to keep you alive. It’s incredibly self-loving and self-caring to embrace that, listen to your body, and give it what it needs to keep you alive.”

Becca, quoted at the beginning of the story, is also leaning in to her progress and coping skills, as well as her hard-earned love of cooking and food.

“Eating is one of the biggest passions in life and it’s one of the ways I’ve reclaimed my relationship with myself, so the sheer apathy towards food in the culture right now makes me very uncomfortable,” she said.

“Knowing that I’m feeding my body the nourishment it needs helps me ignore a lot of the disordered eating nonsense the internet seems to be promoting more and more,” she said."

Henry Ford Health

Many Mediterranean dishes use a clever mix of seasonings in healthful meals made from vegetables and dried fruit. Served on a bed of whole grains, the meals provide a balance of sweet and savory tastes without lots of salt.

In today’s recipe for Moroccan Sheet-Pan Buddha Bowl, we’ve created a satisfying meatless meal with classic Moroccan spices. Typical seasonings in Morocco include cumin, black pepper, ginger and turmeric, along with paprika, cayenne, chili and saffron. In addition, sweet spices (allspice, cloves, cinnamon) are used in veggie dishes.

In our recipe, we’ve sprinkled Moroccan spices on chickpeas and nutritious veggies before roasting them. The same spice mixture is added to plain Greek yogurt for a zesty topping on the roasted vegetables and cooked quinoa.

Just a quick note about herbs and spices: Herbs are the fresh part of the plant. Spices are the dried parts of a plant’s seed, bark, leaves or fruit. For centuries, herbs and spices have been used for medicinal purposes, but the small amounts used for seasoning provide little nutritional value in most dishes. Veggies, however provide lots of health benefits.

Herb tips

Buy herbs that are fresh, clean and without spots.

Trim the stems and place the herbs in water.

Cover them with a paper towel, refrigerate and use them within seven days.

Spice suggestions

Avoid spices with a faded color or those from dusty store shelves.

Buy whole spices when available. Prior to use, grind them for maximum flavor.

Place spices in an airtight container. Freeze if possible.

Replace old spices that have lost their flavor, usually in 6-12 months.

The history of professional wrestling is a story of fixed matches, false narratives and the bloodthirsty consolidation of power. Standing at the heart of this uniquely violent hybrid of sport and entertainment is WWE majority owner and executive chairman Vince McMahon, the (uncooperative) subject of Abraham Riesman’s revelatory new biography, “Ringmaster: Vince McMahon and the Unmaking of America.”

Riesman’s book is a captivating dive into a spectacle that cannot genuinely be categorized as a real sport but that nonetheless relies on the talents of world-class athletes. It’s a story that feels urgent today, thanks in part to McMahon’s recent appearances in the news. He retired as the chief executive of WWE in 2022, in the wake of allegations that he had paid millions to suppress accusations of sexual misconduct and infidelity. In the process of unpacking how we got here, “Ringmaster” draws alarming parallels between the rise of pro-wrestling culture and a political movement that saw a member of the WWE Hall of Fame voted into the White House.

It’s that story — Donald Trump’s relationship with McMahon, as well as their parallel paths to power — that ultimately fuels the book. But long before the two meet, Riesman introduces readers to what has arguably become the central conceit of both figures’ lives: the art of kayfabe. This industry term refers to the way wrestlers proceeded as if the events that played out in the ring were real outside it, too — staying in character for interviews, for example, or acting as if their fictional rivalries bled into their home lives. Kayfabe was predicated on pro wrestling’s decades-long efforts to keep the business’s great secret — that the outcomes of matches are all determined ahead of time — from the public.

As Riesman points out, this charade was never more than a partial success, with news outlets catching on to the grift almost immediately. Today, fans of professional wrestling are overwhelmingly aware of how the business actually works — but that hasn’t stopped them from tuning in and buying tickets to see their favorite goliaths live in the ring. Even without the prospect of real competition, Riesman writes, the appeal of the spectacle endures.

In fact, it may be wrestling’s insistence on an alternate reality built on fakery that makes it feel so essential. As Riesman puts it, “There is no art form more intrinsically and blatantly American — in its casual violence, its bombastic braggadocio, its virulent jingoism, its populist defiance of respectability, and its intermittently awe-inspiring beauty — than professional wrestling.”

And for the past 40 years, McMahon has been the one pulling the strings behind this “blatantly American” art form. As we learn in “Ringmaster,” he is also “likely the closest thing to a friend that Donald Trump has” and “is said to be one of the only people whose calls Trump takes in private.” How did this direct bridge between one of America’s most popular pastimes and a past president running for the office again come to be? It all starts with another Vince McMahon.

Early on, McMahon learned the business at the side of his father, Vince McMahon Sr., also a wrestling promoter. He would go on, however, to break nearly every unwritten rule of wrestling promoting once he was put in charge of WWE (then WWF) in 1982. Riesman writes that McMahon waged a ruthless campaign to put rivals out of business and hold a monopoly on the wrestling entertainment industry. His all-encompassing obsession with wrestling offers a contrast to the subject of Riesman’s previous, equally excellent biography, “True Believer: The Rise and Fall of Stan Lee.” Though each served as the most famous face in his respective industry for decades, Lee’s lifelong ambition was to prove his worth in different mediums (he wanted to be known as a novelist, among other things), even as he served as the figurehead of Marvel Comics. McMahon’s life, by contrast, has always, and only, centered on the spectacle of the ring.

As Riesman shows, McMahon’s early ambitions — including an ill-fated pay-per-view stunt with daredevil Evel Knievel and a wrestling match in Japan in which he begged boxing great Muhammad Ali to take a dive (Ali refused) — didn’t always come to fruition. But his most diabolical stroke of genius would arrive in 1997. That was the year McMahon cast himself as the WWE’s new arch-heel, Mr. McMahon. The announcement effectively reinvented the kayfabe universe of WWE by blurring lines between fact and fiction as McMahon simultaneously continued his real-life reign as the industry’s kingpin and became a star in the ring.

Riesman describes this development as the birth of “neokayfabe,” a new era of pro wrestling in which McMahon’s actual wife, son and daughter were all cast in (often abhorrent) storylines involving elements like supposed kidnappings and suggested sexual assault. By conflating his real-world actions with those of a character designed to rile wrestling, McMahon profited handsomely, giving devotees of his business new incentives to pay for the privilege of hating his guts.

Perhaps no moment encapsulates the opaque miasma of neokayfabe better than the night of May 23, 1999. In service of a storyline for a taping of a weekly WWF program called “Raw Is War,” EMTs and an ambulance were standing by to assist with a scripted “injury” McMahon’s character was to suffer. But instead of helping the fictitiously injured Mr. McMahon, the gathered medical personnel were thrust into genuine action when wrestler Owen Hart accidentally fell from the rafters of Kansas City’s Kemper Arena.

“Television viewers watched Owen, as the Blue Blazer, give his pretaped interview,” Riesman writes. Meanwhile, “in the arena, the live audience saw Owen lying in the ring, surrounded by the EMTs who had been booked for Vince’s fake injury.”

Hart would die almost immediately from his injuries and, tragically, go on to stand in for the many wrestling stars — and others associated with the business — who would suffer in one way or another during McMahon’s tenure. The examples documented in “Ringmaster” are numerous, including the infamous “Montreal Screwjob,” which saw McMahon assist in orchestrating popular wrestler Bret Hart’s unscripted loss to Shawn Michaels in a 1997 title match. (Bret Hart is Owen’s older brother.) They also include chilling accusations of sexual assault from referee Rita Chatterton and lingering questions surrounding the untimely death of Nancy Argentino, girlfriend of former WWF star Jimmy Snuka.

Both seemingly immune to scandals and constantly embroiled in several, McMahon would go on to find a kindred spirit in Trump when the two first partnered in the late 1980s, combining forces for a series of WrestleMania events hosted at Trump casinos and other properties. But their connections would soon run deeper: Looking back 40 years later, the rise of McMahon as a prototype for Trump’s eventual transformation into a political powerhouse is difficult to ignore.

“For more than three decades,” Riesman writes, “Trump has watched and admired Vince’s product. He has been both host and performer at many of Vince’s wrestling extravaganzas, honing his abilities as a rabble-rouser. Through Trump, Vince’s wrestling-infused mentality has reached the highest levels of the American system.”

While Trump’s wrestling appearances are sometimes held up as a point of ridicule — more evidence that he was never qualified for electoral politics — it’s possible that the two pursuits were closely entwined all along. The key to understanding wrestling, as Riesman shows, is to recognize that it is both popular entertainment and a potent political force. This marriage is nothing new. In 1831, for instance, a young man named Abraham Lincoln won a wrestling match in New Salem, Ill. — one of roughly 300 bouts Honest Abe apparently competed in — that provided a local fame he would swiftly parlay into a future in politics. And today, many speculate about the political potential of former WWE star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Few offer a more prescient example of pro wrestling’s appeal as a runway to politics than McMahon’s wife, Linda McMahon.

After two unsuccessful U.S. Senate runs, Linda was among the most generous Republican supporters in the 2016 presidential election, donating $7 million to pro-Trump super PACs. In 2017, she was nominated to Trump’s Cabinet to head the Small Business Administration, and she was overwhelmingly confirmed by a vote of 81-19.

“It was a perfect example of kayfabe morality,” Riesman writes. “Linda had played the role of the kindly, moderate babyface; Trump had been the vicious, extremist heel. But they were working for the same promotion — the Republican Party. The differences between their politics are purely cosmetic.”

Wrestling and politics have been grappling for centuries, the former increasingly providing the latter with a template for its own theater of conflict — a drama neither entirely fake nor fully real.

Also like Trump, McMahon has proved surprisingly resilient, even when seemingly self-inflicted scandals threaten to bring him down. Despite publicly passing the reins to his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, he returned to WWE’s board in January, leading his daughter to abruptly resign and prompting rumors of a possible sale of the business to Saudi Arabia. What comes next is anyone’s guess, but as Riesman’s engrossing biography makes clear, no force has yet succeeded in separating pro wrestling’s most infamous name from the only throne he’s ever known.

When, in 1969, Richard Avedon decided to go big, he’d intuited that it was either that or, as they say, go home. Avedon had been working as a fashion photographer — arguably the best who ever lived — for more than two decades, first at Harper’s Bazaar, then at Vogue. It wasn’t that he was running out of steam exactly. But something had run its course.

Avedon had a revered rival at Vogue: Irving Penn. That was manageable — stimulating, even. But a younger cohort of boundary-pushing photographers, including Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin, was making these two elder statesmen of fashion photography look a little past their prime. Meanwhile, the world at large — in the forms of Vietnam, civil rights, the sexual revolution and a spate of assassinations — was collapsing in on whatever it was they all thought they were up to.

It was time to get up to something else. It was time, for Avedon, to go big.

Avedon didn’t leave Vogue until 1988, when Anna Wintour became its editor and canceled his contract. But he had realized by 1969 that something mattered more to him than fashion photography. And so for a time, he put away his Rolleiflex, the portable camera he’d used to capture leggy models leaping in front of the lens, turned to a 8-inch-by-10-inch Deardorff camera mounted on a tripod and set out to make a series of group portraits large enough to adorn the sides of a big rig.

He made four of them over the next two years. Three are on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 1) in a small but gaspingly potent show marking the 100th anniversary of Avedon’s birth. (He died in 2004.)

The first of the “murals,” as he called them, was a group portrait of Andy Warhol and 10 other members of the Factory. Avedon photographed the superstars in his studio over several weeks in the fall of 1969. Clustered together near the center of the image are five naked figures, one of them the transgender actress Candy Darling. The clothes crumpled on the floor at their feet feel oddly eloquent, legible both as statements of liberation and the shadows of their social selves. (I thought of Rabbit Angstrom, in John Updike’s “Rabbit, Run,” enjoying, as he shed his clothes, the way “the flying cloth puts him at the center of a gathering nakedness.”) “You couldn’t keep the clothes on anybody in those years,” Avedon later joked. “Before you could say ‘hello,’ they were nude and ready to ride.”

The other two are group portraits of the Chicago Seven, who were assembled at the Chicago Hilton during their trial (for conspiring to start a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention), and members of the “Mission Council” — the American military and policy leaders of the Vietnam War, whom he photographed at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. No nudity in either of these — but plenty of implied shadows. The show also includes a smattering of ordinary-size group photographs, including four he took in Saigon in April 1971.

Standing in the long, narrow gallery at the Met is electrifying. Imagine walking into a major museum and seeing three giant murals portraying, respectively, the leading members of the Trump administration, the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement and a selection of, say, today’s biggest social media influencers. Something like that is the general effect.

Together, the murals amount to, if not a picture of society, then certainly a statement about it. They pit establishment power against a new, scruffier and perhaps more vital power. But something more poignant than mere generational conflict is going on here. Tensions exist not only between the pictures but within each one. The Chicago Seven, whose trial was going badly, were beginning to splinter. The Vietnam warmongers knew they were losing and may already have sensed that their infamy would echo through history. Warhol and his Factory entourage, meanwhile, were dealing with the complications of sexual identity, commerce and too many amphetamines. Warhol had been shot by the troubled writer and radical feminist Valerie Solanas less than 18 months earlier and would never fully recover. Avedon captured him here in the early stage of a long creative decline.

As technical feats, Avedon’s murals express their own kind of struggle. They pulse with an almost uncomfortable spirit of rivalry. Conscious that photography was not yet fully accepted as a legitimate art form, Avedon wanted to work on a scale that would compete with group portraits by the likes of Frans Hals and Rembrandt, with large-scale pop and abstract expressionist paintings — and with Times Square billboards. That meant wrestling with the limitations of his medium.

Organizing his subjects and taking the photographs at just the right time was the first challenge: Once film is inserted into an 8-inch-by-10-inch camera, you can no longer use the viewfinder to see what the composition will look like. Enlarging and developing the negatives, Avedon was engaged in a constant battle with dust and other imperfections. Working with a team of assistants, he used the largest available photographic paper and enormous dark room chemical baths.

Unless they’re double-page spreads, fashion photographs commissioned for magazines tend to be in a vertical (portrait) format. In his murals, Avedon wanted the opposite. He wanted something so emphatically horizontal that you would have to walk along its length to take it all in, like a Chinese scroll painting.

In this sense, Avedon was competing, too, with time. In place of the camera’s bias toward snatched, instantaneous time, he wanted his images to be infused with duration. He could have used a wide lens, but he didn’t want the spatial distortion and distancing effect that would have entailed. He preferred instead to crowd the frame, cropping heads and feet, and positioning the camera lower down to create a sense of looming monumentality.

All this created greater immediacy, but it worked against horizontal extension. Avedon’s solution was to combine different exposures. This, too, was technically tricky. Instead of fudging or eliding the vertical joins, he emphasized them, creating multi-paneled photographs where figures or parts of figures are visibly duplicated. Some, like the adult-film star Joe Dallesandro and the film director Paul Morrissey in the Factory picture, appear twice in the image. When the surprise of this wears off, you register that the portrait wasn’t made all at once — that time passed during its creation.

In both format and social ambition, Avedon’s murals hark back to one of the most important paintings of the 19th century: Gustave Courbet’s “The Painter’s Studio,” a slice-of-society ensemble piece which the realist and radical socialist subtitled “A Real Allegory Summing Up Seven Years of My Life as an Artist.” So what was Avedon allegorizing? What was he trying to sum up?

It’s not quite the right question, perhaps: It implies that Avedon had an agenda that was in some way distinguishable from his style. He didn’t. But style, as the British novelist Martin Amis once said, “is not just an icing. It’s an ingredient, perhaps the main ingredient of your way of perceiving things.”

Avedon was obsessed, wrote the photography critic and curator Vince Aletti, “with personal style as an expression of vitality.” Vitality could be expressed as much by the deep fatigue of a coal miner or the intimacy between a war photographer and a correspondent as by ardent youths in designer dresses. If it had a heartbeat, it was vital. Avedon wanted not only to detect the pulse, with a physician’s intimate solicitude, but to amplify and announce it, like a town crier.

To do that, he developed his own style, and it was based, like so many of the best things in art, in the fusion of apparent opposites. Specifically, Avedon was expert at folding naturalism into artifice and maximizing the volume of both.

In his best portraits, he deftly set the eloquence of the body’s many sculptural forms in tension with spontaneous, fly-on-the-wall informality. The two things rarely go together in art, because sculpture implies stasis, whereas informality implies movement. But Avedon found ways to combine both qualities to mutually enhancing effect.

Paintings are portals to presence. It doesn’t matter how long ago they were made, they can’t help but express “here and now.” Photographs, by contrast, are uncannily pure expressions of “there and then.” They might have been taken only an hour ago, but their subjects are irrevocably stuck in the past. Avedon strained against this immutable law with every muscle flex, every mumbled spell he could think to invoke.

Perhaps his primary knack was for contriving a tension between immaculate optics and human entropy. He did it very simply — by setting decrepit human figures (we are all, in our mortality, decrepit) against starchy white, undifferentiated backgrounds. The contrast is what created that “pop” off the walls. But it expressed more than that: It was to become Avedon’s signature style and as such it expressed his strenuously impressive retort to the endless recessive effect, both optical and existential, of the camera lens.

WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. — Juliette Lewis’s early years transpired at breakneck velocity. She worked with Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone, scored an Oscar nomination, dated Brad Pitt and kicked a drug addiction, all before age 22. She’s never been inclined to follow a straight trajectory. So, in 2003, Lewis embarked on a six-year sabbatical from acting to pursue music, her band Juliette and the Licks, opening for the Pretenders and Cat Power. “I went for broke,” says Lewis, which also describes her performances. “When I was on the road, I was flying economy, roughing it like a rock and roller, sleeping on a bunk, traveling on a bus.”

When she returned to acting, the industry had largely forgotten her. It tends to do that. Even with Juliette Lewis, indelible in Scorsese’s “Cape Fear” (opposite Robert De Niro), Stone’s “Natural Born Killers” and Lasse Hallström’s “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape.” On a bus, out of mind.

But Lewis is a trouper, nobody’s snob. She took the long way back, accepting what came her way: sixth-on-the-call-sheet roles, best friend parts, fleeting sitcom appearances, Old Navy ads as a “National Lampoon” Audrey Griswold. (There are three: Lewis was “Christmas Vacation’s” Audrey in 1989.)

Now, at 49, she sits — as much as the kinetic Lewis sits — in a Four Seasons suite, no more bus life for her, as a star of Showtime’s addictive, buzzy “Yellowjackets.” Last season ended with Lewis’s five-times-in-rehab character Natalie suicidal and — spoiler alert! — holed up in a motel room until she was abducted. Lewis’s role is a gift, among the best of her career. The second season began streaming Friday.

“2022 Was the Year of Juliette Lewis” declared IndieWire, and it has a point. She appeared in three television series: as “progressive, sensitive mom” Judy, as she put it, in “Queer as Folk”; big-haired “wild card with a lust for life” fan-turned-costume-designer Denise in “Welcome to Chippendale’s”; and, above all, as Natalie on “Yellowjackets.”

The first two series were limited, one and done, but Lewis will play Natalie for at least a third season and what the producers hope will be five, the longest acting assignment of her career.

“Movies are my jam. They’re my DNA,” she says. “I knew how good the writing was on the show but the drawback was that I’m a commitment-phobe. I was scared of the long-term contract of it. You’re giving up a certain freedom of time.”

But she was attracted to the show’s ambition and the role’s depth. “I always want to try to do things that make me feel scared or go the distance,” she says. “Natalie has that range and specificity. You’re sort of in competition with yourself. You don’t want to repeat. You don’t want to have gimmicks. I try to stretch myself all the time when possible. It’s not unlike life.”

Attired in a jean jacket, red leggings and electric blue sneakers, Lewis erupts in fireworks of thoughts. The linear eludes her. Sentences tend to perambulate only to land in fresh territory.

“I’m a Valley Girl,” she says, though she seems nothing of the sort, the daughter of graphic designer Glenis Duggan Batley and the late character actor Geoffrey Lewis. She was raised in nearby Tarzana as a Scientologist, which she has ceased to discuss publicly. Today, she describes herself as “a spiritualist.”

For the uninitiated, “Yellowjackets” is a female “Lord of the Flies” crossed with “Lost,” but also entirely its own thing. It is macabre, moving, surprisingly funny, punctuated with holy-cow, clutch-your-seat moments, and utterly convincing in dramatizing that few things are more frightening than a pack of empowered teenage girls. The series jumps between 1996, when a champion soccer team is marooned in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash, and present-day New Jersey, as the grown women struggle with the secrets and trauma from their time in the woods.

The adult cast features a trio of gifted, unconventional actresses who first electrified audiences in the Nineties: Lewis, Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci. Observing them perform as an ensemble, it’s a wonder no one thought to cast them together before now.

“I watched Christina and Melanie back then thinking, ‘Oh, there’s another odd one, a rare one,’ which I mean as a compliment,” Lewis says. “I love seeing people doing what you don’t expect. We all work very similarly.” She also refers to herself as “middle aged” and “a veteran,” which sounds impossible to anyone with robust memories of watching Lewis as a teenager in “Cape Fear.” Somehow that was 32 years ago. Lewis describes working with Scorsese and Stone “as my graduate school. Those directors were my teachers.”

As Natalie, Lewis appears in a permanent state of distress and devoid of vanity: rumpled attire, uncombed tresses, melted mascara. “The notion of the stormy waters right at the surface of the character, probably for better or for worse for Juliette, that’s something she immediately empathized with,” says “Yellowjackets” director and executive producer Karyn Kusama. “By the end of the second season, we’re going to have much more insights into the many tragedies of Natalie, how the weight of the past informs the adult character.”

For all her character’s pain, Lewis says, “I feel like Natalie’s the sanest of all of them. I feel like this is how a very broken human being would express herself. If you like some tragedy with your comedy, Natalie will give it to you.”

Lynskey, who stars as Shauna, the Jersey housewife with breathtaking knife skills and myriad secrets, says that “working with Juliette, you’re transported. It’s just crazy what she can do.” Filming a scene this season, “Juliette was so delicate and wounded and interesting. When they said ‘cut,’ it was sort of embarrassing because I was crying a little bit and I was definitely not supposed to be crying. I looked over and so was Lauren Ambrose,” the “Six Feet Under” actress who joins the cast as adult Van.

On set, Lewis has been known to say before an arduous scene, which describes almost all of them, “I hope the angels show up.” Lynskey says, “It really does feel like she’s channeling something.”

“There are moments when Juliette’s on screen and she walks through a room where I’ve never seen someone carve space like that,” says Jonathan Lisco, the series’ showrunner along with creators Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson. “She has an absolute lack of self-consciousness. This season is going to be an up-and-down ride for Natalie. The challenge is for her survival over her demons. Despite what they went through in the woods, all the women have a dynamic longing for that time, that they never felt more.” Among the producers and writers, Lisco says, Natalie is known as “the hunter.” She demonstrates mad firearm skills.

“Natalie vacillates between explosive rage — though she would never hurt you — and then she’s a puddle of sorrow, guilt and shame,” Lewis says. “I just think the showrunners like seeing me angry. It’s exhausting. I exhaust myself. She’s not emoting a lot of lightness or happiness or laughter.” In two seasons, each requiring five-month shoots near Vancouver, “I think there’s only one scene where I laugh, where she’s having a good time for a minute.”

Lewis compares her often-comic scenes with Ricci, who plays semi-sociopathic Misty, to Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?” though “it’s hard to say who is Joan and who is Bette.”

She was delighted for the variety in doing three recent television series, to be in demand, “but that’s not something I think I’ll ever do again.” Her roles in “Welcome to Chippendales” and “Queer as Folk” she described as much lighter, a pleasure while “Natalie is scraping the bottom of the barrel.”

Tate Taylor directed Lewis in “Ma,” “Breaking News in Yuba County” and three episodes on Fox’s “Filthy Rich.” He wanted to cast her in his hit, “The Help,” but Lewis was unavailable. (Which part? “I’m not telling,” Taylor says.) “She is a very energetic actress, a very visceral actress with lots of movement. No part is too small,” he says. “I think she is one of the underutilized talents in our business. She needs to be in everything.”

Away from set, Lewis deviates from any script. She’s the recovering rock and roller who’s happiest at her rural Southern California home with her dogs, on the hunt for a bureau for her bedroom. Married to skateboarder and entrepreneur Steve Berra from 1999 to 2003, Lewis is single, a devoted aunt. She’s the proud owner of a souped-up Dodge Challenger, not unlike the one she and Woody Harrelson drive in “Natural Born Killers.” She once rescued a horse from “a life of being in the movies,” after filming one with the animal in Spain and Mexico. “I paid a whole lot of money to get the horse into the country. Then it turned out the horse was completely unrideable.” So she had the horse retired to a farm for injured animals. “It was very symbolic.”

Lynskey recalled sitting with Lewis last year at the Hollywood Critics Association Awards, where both were nominated for best actress in a dramatic series. (Lynskey won.) Lewis began to worry about how late the event would run, telling her incredulous castmate she had a date afterward. “For most people, that would have been their entire night,” Lynskey says.

During the break between “Yellowjackets” seasons two and three, Lewis is filming “The Thicket” in Calgary. It’s a dark western thriller with Peter Dinklage. She plays a violent killer named Cut Throat Bill. Yes, Bill. says Lewis, “I’ll look slightly unrecognizable.”

After a role like Natalie, “I would like to play a nice, nuanced aristocrat,” she says. Hard to imagine. “So, maybe not. Maybe a jazz singer.” She’s writing a movie, “an exaggeration of themes of things I went through. It’s loosely, loosely autobiographical,” and she wants to direct. “I’ll probably produce stuff. I love storytelling. I want to pitch a TV show, that I won’t be in, about the early punk scene.” She’s interested in “ways to tell stories where I’m not in front of the camera.”

Oh, and she wants to make essential oils. Seriously. Lewis adores essential oils.

“Juliette has such a truly specific and unique take on the world,” Kusama says. “There are times when she just cracked me up with her curiosity and openness.”

Lewis understands the business. “You can always work. You can always get bad work,” she says. “But I have a name now,” meaning she’s matching the performances and roles of her first burst of work three decades ago.

It was never a straight line. For Lewis, that would never make any sense. “But I’ve carved out this funny, funky path I call my own,” she says. And no one is forgetting her now.

On Friday, Searchlight Pictures confirmed that Magazine Dreams, a new film starring Majors, will be released on December 8th. Magazine Dreams has already earned rave reviews after its premiere at Sundance. Magazine Dreams will be the latest of several blockbusters that Majors has starred in in 2023, after the recently-released Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Creed III.

What is Magazine Dreams about?

Magazine Dreams follows aspiring bodybuilder Killian Maddox (Majors), who struggles to find human connection in this exploration of celebrity and violence. Nothing deters him from his fiercely protected dream of superstardom, not even the doctors who warn him of the permanent damage he causes to himself with his quest.

The film also stars Haley Bennett, Taylour Paige, Mike O'Hearn, Harrison Page, and Harriet Sansom Harris.

What are Marvel's plans for Kang?

Following Quantumania, Kang's tenure in the MCU is expected to culminate even further, with Marvel Studios creatives regarding him to be the ""big bad"" of the next few years of the Multiverse Saga. Majors is expected to reprise his role in both Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars.

""It comes down to the cast and with Jonathan Majors, who I think took over the Hall H stage, you know, in the three minutes he was up there,"" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige told ComicBook.com earlier this year. ""It's amazing, and I said to him there's nobody's shoulders I'd rather be putting the multiverse saga on than his. It's really impressive what Jonathan Majors is able to do and all the different incarnations, variants, if you will, of Kang that we will see him do. It's really pretty cool.""

""What I love is that he's totally different from Thanos. That he is completely different. That it's not just how about there's a bigger purple guy with a helmet? That's not what Kang is. Kang is a very different type of villain and the fact that he is many, many different characters is what's most exciting and most differentiates him,"" the executive continued.

2023-03-22,2023-03-22 15:00:00,Portugal’s Tage Studios Promises to Be Europe’s First Entirely Green Shooting Facility,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/portugal-tage-studios-europe-first-all-green-shooting-facility-1235353500/,Business,"This story is part of The Hollywood Reporter’s 2023 Sustainability Issue (click here to read more).

Just outside of Lisbon, plans are underway to build Europe’s, and maybe the world’s, first truly green film studio. The €200 million ($215 million) Tage Studios project, which is set to begin breaking ground near the town of Palmela, southeast of Lisbon, in late 2024 or early 2025, would be the first backlot in Europe built top to bottom with environmental sustainability in mind. Every soundstage and facility building is designed to be a near-zero-energy structure, with rooftop photovoltaic panels providing electricity and rainwater recovery and reuse systems cutting down on water waste. Landscaping will be done to ensure preservation of local biodiversity. Even much of the material used for construction will be locally sourced and/or recycled, with at least 85 percent recovery of all site construction waste.

“The idea was to create a benchmark studio, one that will be eco-friendly and self-sustainable from day one, making it the world’s first for film and television facilities,” says David Hallyday, founder and director of Tage Studios (and, in his day job, a French singer-songwriter and son of late Gallic rock legend Johnny Hallyday, aka the “French Elvis”). “When we started this project, five years ago now, we couldn’t find any studio anywhere that was designed like this, to be a green facility from the start.

“There are a lot of measures that we are taking during construction to save resources, from water to energy to things like lighting and heating,” says Maria Quiros Grande, a real estate director at consultancy giant Deloitte, which is advising Tage on the environmental design of the studio. “We know, for example, that our solar panel system will provide 100 percent of the energy consumption for the studio during the day and more than 50 percent overall.”

Tage Studios’ design will also take into account the operation’s broader environmental impact, with planners working with ecologists to preserve local biodiversity and reduce damage to flora and fauna in the region.

“Biodiversity is something that will be integrated into every stage of the project,” says Grande. “It impacts things as seemingly trivial as window design. All our windows will be deglazed to avoid bird collisions. And the lighting system will be such so that there is minimal light pollution, and operations at night do not disturb the nocturnal rhythms of the surrounding wildlife.”

Major European studio facilities, like London’s Pinewood and Studio Babelsberg outside Berlin, are incorporating green tech and environmental sustainability into their backlot designs, trying to retrofit their facilities to be more eco-friendly. Tage Studios is among the very first to attempt to go green from the get-go.

“There are no examples to follow,” says Hallyday. “Designing everything, from fixtures and equipment to the buildings and grounds, to meet both the highest environmental standards and to provide international productions with the top-level service and reliability they expect — we need this studio to be 24/7, 100 percent reliable and safe from day one — that’s been the biggest challenge.”

Tage Studios picked Portugal for reasons both practical — the coastal nation is among the world’s most solar-friendly, with an average of 300 days of sunshine per year (Hallyday calls it “the California of Europe”) — and political. The Portuguese government is a global leader in environmental policy and has set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of renewable energy, and promote eco-friendly practices.

“Portugal is extremely developed in the sense of sustainability — they are already producing nearly 60 percent of their energy via renewables,” notes Claire Havet, the project manager for Tage Studios. “Lisbon was named the Green Capital of Europe in 2020. We’ve been fully supported by the Portuguese government, who have declared our studio to be of national interest.”

Portugal’s sustainability push dovetails with the country’s move to try and catch up with neighbor Spain, which has enjoyed a film and TV boom over the past decade, fueled by increasing demand from local and global streaming services. Portugal, with its 30 percent tax incentive and stunning national vistas, has been successful in attracting some big international projects: Fast X, the latest in the decidedly carbon-heavy Fast and the Furious franchise, shot in the Viseu and Vila Real regions last spring; Netflix thriller Heart of Stone, starring Jamie Dornan and Gal Gadot, filmed scenes in the coastal town of Bordeira last summer. But the country still lacks a major sound studio.

Plans for Tage Studios would see the creation of a 5,200-square-meter (55,972 square feet) major soundstage along with six other stages ranging in size from 2,000 to 3,600 square meters (21,527-38,750 square feet), with an external backlot area of around 55,000 square meters (592,015 square feet) and an outdoor water tank. Once complete, the facility would be Europe’s largest in terms of studio space, ahead of Pinewood (419,793 square feet of soundstage), Warner Leavesden (381,042 square feet) and Babelsberg (301,389 square feet), though Warner’s huge backlot — more than 55 acres of available space — dwarfs even Tage’s ambitious plans.

The Portugal studio’s true competitive edge, however, could come from its planet-friendly design.

“Think about the technology available now from the ground up. This is not about retrofitting, it’s about state-of-the art innovation for our industry,” said Debbie Levin, CEO of the Environmental Media Association, which is consulting with Tage Studios on the project. “We can’t wait to scream to the world about the opportunity to shoot in this magical, innovative environment.”

Major studios and streamers are now taking the environmental impact of a production into account when deciding where to shoot. And Europe’s entire state-backed film subsidy and tax incentive system is slowly going green. Producers in France will be obliged, as of next year, to submit carbon footprint audits as a condition of securing funding from national film body the CNC. Other national bodies are expected to follow suit. Europe’s Green New Deal, presented by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, sets an ambitious target of making the continent climate-neutral by 2050, a goal that will put further pressure on Europe’s film and TV industry to start making CO2 emissions a factor in funding decisions.

“Planning a studio the way we have, making sustainability and environmental impact a priority at every stage, is very, very expensive and very time-consuming,” admits Hallyday. “But we really don’t have another option. This isn’t something we can do halfway. And we’re confident this is the way the industry is — has to be — in the future.”"

On Spaceship Earth, the famous ride at Walt Disney World’s Epcot Center (it’s the one housed inside the park’s signature geodesic sphere), visitors are transported through humanity’s great achievements, culminating with a projection of the Earth in the vast expanse of space.

Just a half-mile to the west of that sphere, in an open field between Epcot Center Drive and World Drive, sits one of Disney’s most visible efforts to protect the Earth: an enormous, 22-acre array of solar panels, providing electricity to Disney World. Viewing the array from above (or via Google Maps), one can see that it has the unmistakable shape of Mickey Mouse ears.

Disney World’s turn to renewable energy is part of a growing trend among large companies as investors seek out companies that are stewards of the environment — or that are at least willing to tout their eco-credentials.

It’s a big business, with billions of dollars from investors pouring in annually (to the tune of $157.3 billion in 2022, according to Morningstar). And every major public company in entertainment wants a piece of that pot.

And so, Disney, and competitors like Comcast, are building solar arrays to help power their theme parks and offices, while other companies pursue their own eco-friendly efforts.

At Fox Corp., the company touts in its latest Corporate Social Responsibility Report that Fox News field crews “utilize solar-powered generators for daily and breaking news coverage,” and that it is expanding its waste management initiatives on the Fox Studio Lot in Los Angeles.

The company partnered with One Tree Planted to plant new trees across the country, while employees at Fox Sports created what they call the “Fox Sports Carbon Council.” “This group meets monthly and consists of dedicated employees with an interest in sustainability,” the company says in its report. “The purpose of the Council is to share ideas and introduce environmental solutions.”

At NBCUniversal owner Comcast, the company’s 2022 Impact Report detailed plans to recycle fiber-optic cables, and to use recycled packaging for routers.

Disney said in its own 2022 Corporate Social Responsibility Report that it is hoping to reduce its use of paper, palm oil and plastics in its consumer products. It touts the care that the animals that live at its Animal Kingdom theme park receive, and the $120 million and counting that the Disney Conservation Fund has doled out to worthy causes.

And at Netflix, the company is seeking to replace diesel generators for productions with rechargeable batteries.

But the environmental efforts also underscore a subtle but significant fact: Most media and entertainment companies aren’t really major carbon emitters anyway. Other industries with heavy physical footprints or exposure to mining or oil make up the vast majority of ESG (environmental, social and governance) concerns.

“Because of increased investor focus on ESG, increasingly companies have shared their climate-related data,” Cowen analyst Doug Creutz noted in a December report. For media companies in his coverage universe that reported carbon emissions, “total net emissions in 2021 were 40 million tons of CO2, or around 0.1 percent of the global total across all industries,” he found. “Sony, Comcast and Disney accounted for about 70 percent of this total, which is not surprising given their specific industry exposures and overall size. For the companies that have not reported emissions (including Lionsgate and AMC Networks), we believe the total incremental net emissions are not more than 5 million, given reported emissions by peers. In general, our companies are largely devoted to the production of digital goods, which does not impose a significant emissions footprint relative to the size of their businesses.”

Cowen’s chart of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scores, which assess a company’s performance in managing its carbon footprint, ranges from 71 for Comcast, 69 for Sony, 68 for Paramount, 65 for Lionsgate and 55 for Fox to 47 for Disney and 38 for Warner Bros. Discovery. Meanwhile, in air quality — which measures atmospheric pollutants released — Disney (58) and WBD (50) were ahead of peers Comcast (45), Paramount (38) and Sony (35).

It is a fact even acknowledged by Paramount in its 2022 ESG report.

“As a global media company, we are not a major emitter of GHG and we do not consider climate change to be a discretely material issue for our company,” Paramount wrote. “However, we cannot separate ourselves from the growing need for collective action. The impacts of climate change — from worsening storms, wildfires, and droughts to biodiversity loss and sea level rise — will profoundly affect the ways we live and how we must adapt in the future.”

(Among the projects Paramount cited in its report was “waste diversion at RuPaul’s Drag Race,” with sets and props being recycled or re-used.)

In fact, for these companies, actually offsetting their carbon emissions is somewhat trivial.

What would happen if companies chose or were forced to pay to offset all their emissions? “For the most part, our media companies would only take a low to mid single-digit percentage hit to EBITDA if they were forced to fully offset current carbon emissions at the current market price for offsets,” Creutz concluded.

But the relative lack of actual emissions raises another issue: With so much cash being poured into companies that do good for the environment, how is a company with a small carbon footprint supposed to compete?

The answer for entertainment companies is obvious: their content.

Netflix, for example, has an initiative to feature electric vehicles in all of its films and TV series. Earlier this year it announced a partnership with General Motors that will bring that automaker’s cars to Netflix shows.

“Starting in 2022 we committed to including at least one EV in every Netflix produced film and series and this is really part of our broader efforts in the sustainability space,” Netflix CMO Marian Lee told reporters at a virtual press conference last month. “And we do that through a commitment to more sustainable storytelling, which comes to life in two ways, both on screen and behind the camera.”

So for the next Netflix rom-com, don’t be surprised if the protagonist arrives to the wedding in a Bolt.

“We really focus first on educating all of the talent that we work with, so that they can then incorporate the EVs into their storylines in a really organic way, so it doesn’t feel out of place,” Lee adds.

But that’s not all. Netflix says it is trying to incorporate positive messages related to sustainability in its programming.

“The breakout success of Don’t Look Up confirmed our analysis from last year’s report: hundreds of millions of households choose to watch titles that shine a light on sustainability,” the company wrote in its latest ESG report. Among the show’s cited are Bo Burnham’s Inside, Ada Twist Scientist and Life in Color With David Attenborough.

But Netflix is far from alone.

“Through National Geographic, Disneynature, and our other content platforms, Disney enjoys a rich and growing library of programming that connects audiences with the wonders of our natural world and inspires action to create a cleaner, safer, and healthier planet,” Disney wrote in its latest report, also calling out ABC News programming.

And Comcast/NBCUniversal used its report to tout “programming with a purpose.”

“In 2021, we leveraged the reach of our programming and personalities to spotlight pressing climate challenges facing our world,” the company wrote. “The goal? Inspiring thoughtful conversation on creating a more sustainable planet.”

NBC News and NBC’s late night shows were cited, as well as a “net zero carbon football game” that aired on Sky.

But the continued focus on ESG also finds itself at something of a crossroads. While billions are still pouring into ESG funds and ETFs, the actual volume of inflows has been on the decline in recent years.

And BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who has long pushed for companies to embrace their ESG bona fides (BlackRock is the largest owner of ETFs and index funds), seemed to walk back his prior calls in this year’s letter to shareholders March 15.

After stating that adapting to a changing climate should remain a top priority for investors and executives, he explains why he has been so vocal about ESG in his annual letters.

“As minority shareholders, it’s not our place to be telling companies what to do. My letters to CEOs are written with a single goal: to ensure companies are going to generate durable, long-term investment returns for our clients,” Fink writes. “But as I have said consistently over many years now, it is for governments to make policy and enact legislation, and not for companies, including asset managers, to be the environmental police.”

For entertainment companies, the rush to sustainability has proven itself an opportunity to show off that they care, through their content.

Give up your climate guilt.

That’s the title of the first episode, and one of the principal themes, of A Matter of Degrees, a podcast for the climate curious from policy experts and advocates Leah Stokes and Katharine Wilkinson. The idea that fighting climate change is a lost cause, or one requiring an unrealistic level of personal sacrifice, is a kind of trap, they say, that leads to defeatism and inaction and lets institutions off the hook. Stokes and Wilkinson instead cut through the noise by conducting deep-dive investigations into greenwashing and other environmental misdeeds, and by showing how existing technology and policies — if widely and intelligently rolled out — can make a difference on the structural level.

Along the way, the hosts keep things accessible by bringing in big names, such as Vice President Kamala Harris, and bona fide climate advocates like Sonia Aggarwal, Donnel Baird, Jesse Jenkins, Jamie DeMarco and Quentin Scott to talk real solutions. THR spoke with Stokes, a professor of environmental politics at UC Santa Barbara, about the impact of the podcast and steps Hollywood can take to combat the climate crisis.

What have been some of the most interesting stories you’ve run across in making the podcast?

We did an episode last season, in season two, that looked at this fake grassroots campaign in Southern California. It was called Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions. So there was a requirement that if you build a new house, it has to be all electric, which has been done in 75 cities in California. And so Santa Barbara was going to do it, and basically, this front group, which actually was represented by the gas utility, sent text messages to tens of thousands of people in the community lying to them, and all these people wrote to the city council, being like, “Oh my God, you’re gonna take away my gas stove!” or whatever, which was not true. It was lies. We did a whole episode talking about this dark-money astroturfing group. That no longer exists, that fake campaign. There is no more Californians for Balanced Energy Solutions. You cannot go on their website. They don’t exist anymore. So that’s kind of cool.

Have you received an influx of trolling or misinformation from climate deniers?

The vast majority of Americans think that climate change is real — it’s happening now. Deniers are maybe 10 percent of the population. It’s really not the majority by any means. It’s a very small minority. Our show is really for folks who want to go deeper on the climate issue and are concerned about it, which is the vast majority of American people, and we want to get into the details in an accessible way that people can understand, but that actually goes quite deep. In some ways, we’re more like a Climate 201 rather than a Climate 101.

How have you been thinking about the balance between the personal choices people can make and the roles the government and corporations have in combating the climate crisis?

That’s a really core topic to our show. Our first episode is called “Give Up Your Climate Guilt,” and it was kind of a manifesto for why this is not some individual problem for you to go solve by yourself. A lot of folks have lied to us about climate change for years and delayed us. We had [the environmentalist] Bill McKibben on the show, and he talks about how the most important thing you can do is not recycle, it’s to organize and join organizations and be part of the movement.

That being said, at the beginning of season three, we did this miniseries called “What Can I Do?” that does talk about, on the personal level, what are the most important things you can do? What we really try to explain to people is that you have to look at larger systems; for example, if you electrify your life and remove fossil fuels from your home, that is changing infrastructure. That is a much bigger change than, for example, recycling.

People kind of think of climate activism or action in one way, which is really about consumer choices, behavioral choices, and what we try to do is get people to think about structural change, even on an individual level.

Courtesy of A Matter of Degrees

What’s the best way to communicate with family members or people who don’t understand the urgency of climate change or feel the impact of their personal choices?

It’s not really about sacrifice. So much of the branding, both from the movement and also from folks who don’t want us to transition off of fossil fuels, has been painting what we’re doing as being sacrifice. I have an EV, I have solar on my roof, I have two heat pumps — one for my water, one for heating and cooling my home. I have all these things and guess what? I can still take a hot shower; I can still drive around. I can still do all the things that I could do with fossil fuels.

That’s when we’re going to win, when people really understand that, actually, it’s just better to not poison myself while I cook myself lunch by combusting gas in my house. And it’s just better to drive an EV because it’s cheaper and I don’t have to worry about high [gas prices].

What can Hollywood do?

Hollywood has a role to play here too: How do we make sure that the film sets are electric? So many of these things are running off of diesel generators right now, but we have technologies like batteries, and there are new startups that are offering the ability for shoots to be done on electric, and that’s amazing. With the Inflation Reduction Act, there’s tons of money from the federal government to help you do that. You can get 30 percent of the cost back for solar and batteries, for example, through tax credits.

And, of course, Hollywood has a massive platform to tell stories. We need more climate stories. We need more diverse climate stories. And there’s tons of climate people who are willing to work with folks in Hollywood to get the stories right. The stories, I think, are getting better over time on climate.

I watched this hilarious TV show, Partner Track, over the summer about a lawyer — it was on Netflix. The whole plotline was that there was this new clean-tech startup. This entrepreneur was making this new technology, and then he got bought out by a fossil fuel company with the plan to shut him down. What the lawyer does is she shows up at the annual meeting and tries to get the votes to undermine this takeover, which is exactly what happens in the climate space. We do shareholder activism. It was really cool to see this storyline that actually reflects what the climate movement is doing, what technology is like. It was actually extremely well done for a climate plotline, and it’s not like 90 percent of people who watch this show are gonna think that’s a climate plotline."

The new address, which includes the UTA Artist Space Gallery open to the public, follows UTA locations in Beverly Hills, Nashville, New York, Chicago and London. The new satellite office in mid-town Atlanta aims to identify for UTA new artists, athletes, musicians and brands with strong ties to Georgia and the U.S. southeast.

“Atlanta is a vibrant city for music, sports and arts, and there is a ripe opportunity to create another center of gravity for film and television,” UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer said in a statement on Wednesday. Hollywood film and TV production in Georgia, which includes series like Stranger Things, Ozark and Atlanta, continues in strength thanks to the U.S. state’s generous tax incentive program.

The UTA Atlanta office, filling 20,000 square feet and three floors on Peachtree Street, will be run by co-heads Steve Cohen and Rob Gibbs as they offer representation across divisions like music, sports, film, television, digital talent, marketing, gaming and fine arts.

UTA will also advise top global brands based in Atlanta and the region on working with the creative community. The UTA Artist Space Gallery will feature rotating exhibits as an extension of the agency’s UTA Fine Arts division, led by partner and creative director Arthur Lewis."
2023-03-22,2023-03-22 14:28:52,Traditional banks rely on ‘tiny buffer’: Paris Blockchain Week 2023,https://cointelegraph.com/news/traditional-banks-rely-on-tiny-buffer-paris-blockchain-week-2023,Business,"The first day of Paris Blockchain Week (PBW) is providing more thoughts on the ongoing crisis in the global banking system, with industry executives comparing the collapses of major cryptocurrency firms like FTX with the fall of banks like Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).

On March 22, PBW hosted a panel discussion titled “FTX, Luna, Celsius, 3AC: From Hero to Zero,” bringing together industry executives from the blockchain venture firm Node Capital, crypto-friendly Six Digital Exchange, Delta Growth Fund and crypto liquidity provider Woorton. The panel took place on PBW’s Mona Lisa stage.

According to Woorton co-founder and head of trading Zahreddine Touag, the FTX and Celsius-related meltdown in the crypto industry has been triggered by different reasons than those that fueled the ongoing banking crisis.

“It's lack of due diligence from the investors, lack of risk management from the players,” Touag said, referring to collapses like FTX. He noted that investors often don’t realize risks of holding their crypto assets, mistakenly thinking that regulated platforms are protected from losses, stating:

“If you get regulated in France, you just have to do KYC and AML. When you do KYC, AML, it doesn't protect you from losing the money. It does not at all. And in a lot of countries, a lot of people think that being regulated is being protected.""

There are also many other reasons, like greed, especially seen among young and inexperienced investors, Touag said. According to the exec, the FTX and Celsius contagion is still not over and industry players are still looking at each other, wondering who is impacted or not. “Many are impacted and we don't know. So for the next few months, there will be more news,” he stated.

Unlike crypto collapses, the ongoing global banking issues were mainly driven by the fragility of the whole model of traditional banks, according to Touag.

“Some people are aware, but not everyone is aware that this fractional reserve system with the banks makes it very fragile,” the Woorton executive stated, adding that banks only have about 12% of their funds liquid. He said:

“The trillions they say they have on their books, they don't have it. It's elsewhere. It's invested, it's in the market, but they don't have it. So they rely on this tiny buffer, 12%.”

Touag added that troubled banks like SVB often depend on jurisdictions in Europe and the United States, while relying on this “tiny buffer” and expecting that “no one will pop up at the store asking for money.” According to Touag, it’s the same story with bigger banks like Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan, but people keep thinking that they are “too big to fail.”

“That's what happened with SVB,” Touag said, adding that Silvergate’s issue was “a bit different.” He also argued that Signature’s crisis is “another story, because the bank is not closed.” Touag stressed that Signature was just taken over and that his company used Signature the morning of this discussion. He added:

“In the crypto banking system, the best place to bank is Signature. Why? Because the regulator said that they will make every single depositor whole. So, we know that our money is safe there; even if they go bankrupt, our money is saved while we look for alternatives.”

As previously reported, the New York State Department of Financial Services took over Signature on March 12, appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the receiver. According to Barney Frank, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, the regulators took action against Signature despite no insolvency."

The companies announced the new deal Wednesday morning, adding that Newsmax will return to DirecTV and its streaming offering on Thursday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, though DirecTV says Newsmax will be available at no extra cost to customers.

“This resolution with Newsmax, resolving an all-too-common carriage dispute, underscores our dedication to delivering a wide array of programming and perspectives to all our customers,” said Bill Morrow, DirecTV’s CEO, in a statement. “Through our persistent negotiations, we reached a resolution under mutually-agreeable business terms allowing us to deliver the conservative news network at the right value – a reflection of the free market at work.”

Newsmax can trace its origins on TV to DirecTV, with founder and CEO Chris Ruddy transforming his media company into a TV company thanks in part to a deal with the satellite giant. Newsmax was also available to stream for free online, which became a sticking point in negotiations, as pay-TV providers typically pay for exclusivity.

When Newsmax was pulled from DirecTV in January, it became national news, with a number of high-profile Republican politicians weighing in and threatening to demand hearings featuring Morrow and other executives, and arguing that the satellite company was censoring conservatives.

Ruddy is well-connected in GOP political circles, and in a new statement took a more tempered approach to the dispute.

“Newsmax recognizes and appreciates that DirecTV clearly supports diverse voices, including conservative ones,” said Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax. “As a standalone company, DirecTV gave Newsmax its start nearly a decade ago as it continues to do with upcoming news networks, which is why we are pleased to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that will deliver our network to DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-verse customers over the next several years.”

In a little under two years, since she minted her first NFT in March 2021, she has caught the attention of prolific collectors, such as Punk6529, DC Investor and Bob Loukas, and recently left her software engineering job to pursue life as a full-time artist.

“I studied art history, took studio art courses, but also studied computational science and engineering. I made all sorts of art growing up, but it was more in a traditional media way. As a software engineer, I was always hoping to combine my love for programming as well as my love for art and creativity,” says Xie.

Discovering generative art

“I found that desire in generative art in around 2015–2016. It made a lot of sense making art with code. You don’t get any more of a direct and elegant combination than that of those two fields.”

“It’s so full of exploration. You’re engaging with technology in a way that’s creative because it exercises both sides of the brain, and that’s a rare thing to encounter.”

Xie attributes her love for making generative art to the freedom it gives her to let her creativity loose, and she gets lost in the process.

“Generative art is meditative for me. Whenever I made it, I got really sucked into it. The world around me would just disappear, and I would spend hours just programming and seeing what the algorithm might do.”

“Prior to NFTs, there was not very much opportunity to actually make a living out of it. When NFTs did come along, it was the first time where I actually saw a pathway for myself to be making a living as an artist.”

Inspired by East Asian art, Xie’s collection “Memories of Qilin” was launched via Art Blocks a year ago and has now seen over 4,400 ETH ($7.4 million at the current ETH price) in secondary sales.

In July 2022, Xie teamed up with Bright Moments for her 100-piece collection “Off Script,” which is an algorithmic representation of a 20th-century modern art collage.

Just recently, the New York resident engaged in a collaboration with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and she also has worked with SuperRare and Objkt (Tezos).

Influences

Xie takes influence from many artists and styles but specifically singles out Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hokusai, best known for the famous big wave woodblock print, and Spanish painter Picasso who revolutionized abstract art with cubism.

“For me, I love abstract expressionists and early modern collage artists, but a few names that come to mind are Hokusai and Picasso,” she says, also referencing the “Fidenza” NFT artist Tyler Hobbs.

“There’s a lot of generative artists that have inspired me over the years. Tyler Hobbs is one of those. I’d also say Zach Lieberman has been a huge inspiration,” says Xie.

“In general, the genre influences for me are collage and textiles. I draw a lot of real-world inspiration from them.”

Personal style of generative art

Xie’s aesthetically pleasing style takes inspiration from traditional East Asian art, and she has a knack for creating pieces that can be studied with the naked eye at length.

“I would say that my personal style is very influenced by textiles, patterns, collage and wallpaper. This idea of bringing together a lot of different patterns and putting them into one piece and seeing how that can create something so cohesive — that’s really interesting to me,” Xie states.

Her work brings human warmth to what could be a sterile nature of computer-generated art.

“I would say that, a lot of times, my artwork tends to have a very organic feel. It explores this tension between what is handmade and appears very human versus what is computational and somewhat cold and robotic.”

“It’s very fascinating to me to bring in a sense of organic and human into a medium that’s inherently digital with the code I use.”

Notable generative art sales to date

“Memories of Qilin #191” sold for 55.55 ETH on Nov. 4, 2022 ($91,380 equivalent on the date of sale). This sale went from Bob Loukas to the Punk6529 Museum. (OpenSea) “Flowers and Bloom” sold for 30 ETH on Nov. 19, 2022 ($36,495 equivalent on the date of sale). This sale was via Unit London. (Unit London) “Memories of Qilin #442” sold for 40 ETH on Nov. 4, 2022 ($65,800 equivalent on the date of sale). (OpenSea)

NFT artists to watch

Xie points out a number of up-and-coming NFT artists she’s excited about.

William Mapan — An artist who works with code and has been featured on Art Blocks, Bright Moments and at Sotheby’s.

“William is an incredible artist. He has all these beautiful, hand-drawn-looking works. His series ‘Anticyclone’ is just stunning, and I’ve collected one. I think he really loves drawing inspiration from traditional media as well.”

Iskra Velitchkova — A computational generative artist who’s also been featured at Sotheby’s.

“Her work has a very digital quality to it. Whilst digital, it’s also deeply atmospheric. Her style is so consistent. If you see an Iskra Velitchkova piece, you know it’s hers.”

Sasha Stiles — A metapoet and AI researcher.

“Sasha is doing some amazing work around artificial intelligence and poetry. It’s very cutting edge in my opinion.”

Generative art process

Using a combination of traditional sketching, photoshop and writing algorithms, Xie’s process can be quite time-consuming and detailed.

“Programming is a pretty intensive process, so you want to visualize what you’re trying to program as concretely as possible before doing it. I typically do that in Photoshop and sketch out what happens if I add a line to a given element. I’ll look to see if that makes sense. If it looks good, I will then program it out and see where that takes me,” says Xie.

“Often, it starts with a pretty extensive mood boarding process where I’ll go and collect a bunch of images that I love that I’m inspired by. That gives me an idea of what I’m interested in at that moment. Sometimes, I can’t articulate or vocalize that myself; it’s a very subconscious thing.”

“Off Script #62” by Emily Xie. (OpenSea)

Once Xie has an idea of what she wants to make, she starts to code to create the output.

“When I’ve got my inspiration, I then start tinkering around with algorithms. Sometimes, that means revisiting an algorithm that I’ve already written or learned about, for example, flow field. From there, it’s a matter of trying to draw inspiration from other elements and attempting to recreate them using code.”

“Typically, what that means is you’ll lay down some lines of code and then you’ll see what it produces, and it’ll render on your screen. From there, it becomes an iterative process of playing with parameters. For example, if you constrained one parameter, you might get wavy lines instead of something else. You’re constantly going back to your code, editing it and rendering it, and then repeating that process over and over again until you get something you like.”

“Throughout my programming process, I actually try to prototype rapidly as much as possible because you can also run into the problem where you have an idea and spend all day programming it out, but it looks bad, and you’ve wasted all that time.”

Physical-to-digital art paradigm shift

Xie says that tokenized digital art is turning the traditional relationship between original and reproduction on its head.

“It’s interesting because, in the past, the “Mona Lisa” physical object is the true piece. Then every other picture of it you find floating around on the internet is just a manifestation of it. In this paradigm, it’s the complete opposite, which is really funny. I think it’s really important because, for the longest time, the traditional model left digital artists without a real way to assign originality and collectibility to the artwork,” Xie says.

“In the past, there wasn’t an easy way for my generative art to be collected. How do you collect something that sits on your computer but could be transferred to any computer all around the world with a click of a button? It required a way to assign rarity to a JPEG. NFTs are it. If people really think about it, it makes so much sense, and it opens up digital art to be finally appreciated and collected.”

Favorite NFT you own

“I would have to say ‘Anticyclone’ by William Mapan and ‘Folio #22’ by Matt DesLauriers. I love both of those pieces that I’ve collected.”

The speech opened by touching on the general distrust of cryptocurrencies — primarily Bitcoin (BTC) — from centralized governments. “I think they are absolutely panicking right now,” he said.

Draper particularly angled his thoughts through the lens of the recent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis, which he called a “crisis of trust.”

“They have shaken our confidence in the banking system… What a really strong leader would do is build that trust back. Trust the banks that now remain and set them free.”

However, according to the investor, a smooth transition out of these latest bank failures will not be likely under the current leadership in the United States. He signaled the recent remarks against cryptocurrencies stemming from the White House.

His whole speech boiled down to his belief that an inevitable change is coming stemming from decentralized financial tools like Bitcoin, calling it a “drumbeat that keeps coming and coming.”

“Everything got wealthier as more liquidity was created for the world — every time there was a leap in currency. We’re going through an anthropological change, which is hard for people. A lot of people resist it.”

He continued by saying that weak leaders will be revealed by those who resist it. Whereas strong leaders embrace it and are looking for this change. He concluded his speech with a three-minute song, which he wrote and performed.

According to Draper, the song was written four years ago but is more relevant than ever today. It touched on Satoshi, Bitcoin, banks, governments and the want for a new world order.

Before he began, he dedicated the song to SVB and “all the banks that have failed and will fail.”

“And I dedicated to all those governments that if they don’t trust their people and set them free, they will also fail, and their currencies will also fail.

The song got a round of applause from the audience, as well as the panelists who followed Draper on the master stage.

He concluded his time by saying blockchain, Bitcoin and smart contracts are making up one of the “greatest transitions in the history of the world,” and it should be embraced."

On March 21, ARK sold 160,887 Coinbase shares from its ARK Fintech Innovation exchange-traded fund (ARKF) for $13.5 million, according to an investor notification seen by Cointelegraph.

The transaction became ARK’s first sale of Coinbase stock in 2023, following three months of active buying. The amount sold accounts for 23% of all Coinbase stock acquired by ARK so far in March and about 9% of all Coinbase shares bought by the firm so far this year.

After the sale, ARK holds nearly 1.6 million Coinbase shares bought in 2023. The shares are worth more than $132 million at the time of writing.

The latest sale comes amid Coinbase stock, which trades as COIN, seeing a significant surge in price, with the shares touching multimonth highs this week.

On March 21, COIN stock closed at $83.99, hitting the price level for the first time since September 2022, according to data from TradingView. The stock has recovered more than 130% since the beginning of the year but is still down about 54% over the past 12 months.

The upward movement of the Coinbase stock price aligns with a more positive trend in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting multimonth highs amid the ongoing global banking crisis. On March 22, Bitcoin hit nine-month-highs above $28,000, significantly recovering price levels triggered by the industry crisis triggered by collapses like FTX.

The news comes soon after ARK made its biggest Coinbase stock purchase in 2023. On March 9, Wood’s investment manager bagged 301,437 Coinbase shares for its ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and 52,525 shares for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). At the time of the purchase, the stock batch was worth about $20.5 million, while its current value is nearly $30 million."

The Loews, the iconic Pacific-facing hotel in Santa Monica that since 1991 has provided shelter for thousands of film buyers and sales execs (and a whole lot of insane movie posters, many involving sharks), has now closed for major renovations. While the site is due to reopen later this year, it’s being rebranded Regent Santa Monica Beach, having become a new addition of the IHG Hotels & Resorts portfolio.

As such, organizers of AFM — The Independent Film & Television Alliance — have found new lodgings for their annual deal-making get-together in the Le Meridien Delfina at 530 Pico Blvd. While the hotel doesn’t quite match the beach-side location of the Loews (it’s roughly a 10 minute walk away), it is considerably more modern, having opened in 2013 (the Loews first opened in 1989).

“Though that 30-year era has ended, we are delighted that our new location means you will be returning to the same sunny beachside city for AFM 2023, to familiar places and faces, and that you will be part of this exciting new chapter for the market,” the IFTA said in a statement. “This move to Le Méridien just down the street will provide a new look for the AFM and a dynamic and innovative backdrop for you and your company to unite with the global film industry, showcase and discover the latest projects and offerings, connect with partners, and engage in conversations about marketplace insights and trends.”

The 2023 AFM is due to take place Oct. 31- Nov. 5."

A Cruise robotaxi operating without a safety driver recently collided with a San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (Muni) bus. There were no reported injuries. While the bus sustained modest damage, the damage to the Cruise vehicle’s front bumper was more severe.

At the time of the incident, the Cruise robotaxi was not carrying any passengers. The GM self-driving unit addressed the incident in a brief statement: “Yesterday, one of our vehicles made contact with the rear of a Muni bus. No injuries were reported, and there were no passengers present in the Cruise AV. We are investigating the incident and will take follow-up actions if appropriate.”

Based on Cruise’s comment and a photo of the incident, it appears that the robotaxi rear-ended the bus at a relatively low speed. A picture of the accident shared on social media shows the robotaxi still in contact with the bus. The impact occurred just after a bus stop too, which further suggests that the collision likely happened at low speeds, as noted in a Forbes report. The Cruise vehicle’s airbags did not seem to have deployed either, as seen in the photo.

This incident highlights the need for Cruise to further optimize its robotaxi fleet in San Francisco for real-world use. One could infer that the robotaxi’s suite of sensors should have detected the Muni bus, and should thus have stopped before the collision happened.

Given the damage caused by last night’s storms, some of our cars briefly entered areas with downed trees or power lines. Some were able to proceed autonomously, but where needed we immediately dispatched teams to remove the vehicles. — cruise (@Cruise) March 22, 2023

In a recent, separate incident, a Cruise robotaxi encountered fallen trolley wires during a high-wind storm. The vehicle drove through “caution” tape that was closing off a road and struck the non-live wires. While twisted caution tape may be difficult for sensors like LIDAR and radar systems to detect, trolley cables are thicker and are likely substantially more visible.

Although the recent storms in San Francisco have presented challenges, it can be assumed that Cruise has simulated such scenarios during its robotaxis’ training and testing processes. The incidents involving the Muni bus and trolley wires highlight the importance of real-world testing and edge case training for robotaxis to help ensure their safe operation. This is something that other companies which are also pursuing robotaxi technology — such as Waymo and Tesla — should really emphasize.

Even though only 5% of those working in video game development identify as Black, Black gamers and developers have had a significant impact on the industry.

SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

Black pioneers in video game development have pushed the field forward. There's Jerry Lawson, who helped make video games playable at home, and Ed Smith, who reimagined consoles in those early days of at-home gaming. But even though there are hundreds of thousands of jobs in the video game industry nowadays, Black people hold only 5% of those jobs. That's according to a 2021 survey from the International Game Developers Association. But their numbers have been growing. So NPR's Brianna Scott spoke with some Black indie video game developers about how they got their start.

BRIANNA SCOTT, BYLINE: Growing up as a kid in Texas, Xalavier Nelson Jr. knew he wanted to be part of the video game industry.

XALAVIER NELSON JR: I was reading an article about ""Duke Nukem Forever,"" a kind of infamously panned video game, and it mentioned that game journalists got games for free. And I was like, oh, game journalists get games for free. That is the only job that makes sense for a child in this world. So thanks to the power of the internet, at 12 years old, I pretended to be an adult, and I got my first job.

SCOTT: Bold move for a preteen, but it worked. He began reviewing game from companies like Activision and Bandai Namco Entertainment. Soon, Nelson was writing for well-known industry outlets like PC Gamer and Polygon. And before he was old enough to even vote, Nelson had gained a lot of insight into the video game industry, like how grueling it can be.

NELSON: I decided I didn't want to be a part of it anymore.

SCOTT: But there was one thing he still wanted to try - making his own video game, even though he knew the industry had its issues.

NELSON: The problem is - I loved it. I found a deep joy and satisfaction in the process of making a video game.

SCOTT: That first game he developed would start him down a path of working on various games with varying roles, from creative director to narrative designer, like on the game Space Warlord Organ Trading simulator.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME MUSIC)

NELSON: It is a virtual stock ticker and auction interface set in the far future, where you are buying and selling the one thing everyone needs and has at the end of the world - meat, organs...

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME MUSIC)

NELSON: ...Juicy, jiggly bits.

SCOTT: Or An Airport For Aliens Currently Run By Dogs, which, yes, is exactly like what you're probably thinking right now.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You get a boarding pass, 50 boarding passes if you want. That dog has short-term memory loss. He's just happy to help you look. You look for your flight...

SCOTT: And that was sort of the catalyst for Nelson founding his own video game studio, Strange Scaffold, in 2019. He started with a $2,000 investment from his dad. That 2,000 grew to 40,000 through what Nelson says was elbow grease and the grace of God.

NELSON: Strange Scaffold has now released five games, completing our sixth, got two more at least releasing this year. That all came from an amount of money that I had been told when I started my studio is not enough to make a video game or to pay people effectively, and we've managed to do both.

CATT SMALL: We are actively giving people money to make their video games. Like, we're just trying our best to remove the barriers.

SCOTT: Catt Small is another developer and product designer based in New York City. She says access to capital is just one thing that can prevent Black people from getting into the video game industry, which is one of the reasons that Small and a fellow group of developers organized the Game Devs of Color Expo, a place to showcase their games and connect developers with the people who write checks. Small herself start coding at the age of 10. She wanted to make her own dress-up doll game.

SMALL: The thing that I really have always loved about games is the ability to become something else or to imagine different worlds.

SCOTT: One game Small has developed is called Sweetheart. You play as a 19-year-old Black girl from the Bronx going through the ups and downs of everyday life.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME MUSIC)

SCOTT: Choices like what you decide to wear affect how you're treated in the game, and it highlights some of the microaggressions Black women face.

SMALL: Being a woman - a Black woman in New York City, you experience a fair amount of street harassment. And a man actually told me that he was not going to harass women or catcall women anymore after playing the game.

SCOTT: Without Black people in the driver's seat, games like that probably wouldn't exist or have the same kind of impact.

NEIL JONES: Race is a big part of games these days. I feel like the characters that we play, the people that make the games, they all kind of need to kind of represent something.

SCOTT: Neil Jones, better known as Aerial_Knight, is another video game developer who wants to see more people who look like him in the industry. He's based in Detroit, and his grandma who raised him is actually part of the reason he got into video games.

JONES: And my favorite thing was after she would get done, you know, working and cooking and all that stuff, she would just want to play Bejeweled. And I would sit there and watch her. And then she would give me the controller, and I'd try to beat her score. And we'd go back and forth.

SCOTT: Jones taught himself most of what he knows today about video game development. The first game he developed and published is called Never Yield. Now, if you're familiar with the game, Temple Run, Jones says Never Yield is kind of similar. Set in a futuristic Tokyo-style Detroit, you play as a lost person being chased by enemies.

JONES: This one has, like, cutscenes. The player interacts with their environment. It has a lot of freedom of movement. I spent a lot of time with my friend Dan doing a full original soundtrack.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""THE MAN WHO OUTRAN TIME (FEAT. AUSTIN C​.​)"")

NEIL J AND DANIEL WILKINS: (Rapping) ...In the mix. Ain't never seen anything quite like this. In a league of my own, I'm one of a kind. I be in the zone. I be on the grind.

JONES: We had rappers come in, singers come in and do - and record over that. That's not really something you see a lot of in games, especially indie games.

SCOTT: For Jones, this was his game to prove himself as a developer, and he made it all on his own dime.

JONES: I've been trying to get into the game industry for so long. Let me make my own thing. If I'm never going to make it into the game industry, let me make a perfect example of - this is what they're rejecting.

SCOTT: His quote, ""perfect example"" of a game was a success. Never Yield was released in 2021 on several major gaming platforms. But Jones believes skilled video game developers like him should be further along in their careers.

JONES: By now, I should be, like, a studio lead or some kind of like - leading some massive project.

SCOTT: Many video game companies pledged in 2020 to do better when it comes to diversity and inclusion. But something I heard from a lot of the Black developers I spoke with is that when they're offered opportunities at bigger companies, sometimes those offers are below their skill level.

JONES: I don't think we'll ever be able to fix the original sin of, like, these massive studios who have hired people over the last 20 years actively not hiring Black people. We can never make up for the lost time.

SCOTT: But Jones isn't dwelling on that lost time. He's staying creative and encouraging other Black people, especially kids, to get into the video game industry despite the barriers.

JONES: I talked to so many Black parents whose kids were so interested in gaming. And, you know, I kind of just told them, like, there's a lot of different jobs in gaming - community managers to, like, project managers. He doesn't have to be a master at coding or be a master artist to kind of get into this. People say that, you know, the journey that I took was inspirational, and I never saw it like that. And so I talked to all those kids and those families.

SCOTT: Find your own space and voice, he says, and just do what you like the most. Brianna Scott, NPR News.

NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Mark Pocan, Democratic congressman of Wisconsin, about this week's hearing that featured TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, and how he thinks lawmakers should regulate the app.

SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

On Thursday, the CEO of TikTok testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was grilled by representatives from both parties.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GUS BILIRAKIS: Your technology is literally leading to death.

FRANK PALLONE JR: You know, you say you're benign. You want to do good things for the public. So let me ask you, what about a commitment that says that you won't sell the data that you collect?

GARY PALMER: Yes or no - do you screen against content from nations that commit crimes against humanity?

DETROW: That was Republican Congressman Gus Bilirakis of Florida, Democrat Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and Republican Gary Palmer of Alabama. In recent months, opposition to TikTok has gained momentum in the United States, with more and more lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans, raising concerns that TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, might be sharing data from U.S. users with the Chinese government. Many are calling for a ban on the massively popular app that boasts 150 million U.S. users. Despite the growing opposition to the app in Congress, a relatively small group of Democratic representatives have spoken out against a proposed ban on the app.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMAAL BOWMAN: This is more governing through fearmongering without actual evidence.

DETROW: That's Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Democrat from New York. Making the case alongside Bowman is a fellow progressive, Mark Pocan, Democratic congressman from Wisconsin, who joins me now. Good afternoon.

MARK POCAN: Glad to be here.

DETROW: At this point, there's a pretty broad bipartisan consensus on this issue. I guess my question to you is, why are so many of your colleagues wrong?

POCAN: Well, this is kind of the classic difference of what a member of Congress is and what the country is. There's a real issue out there, and we should be addressing our privacy of our data across all social media platforms. The problem is we see the bull's-eye in front of us, and then they're shooting 90 degrees to the left or right, trying to figure out how to address it by trying to ban a platform. In reality, we have to take on all the platforms to make sure that we're protecting people and the privacy of their data. But, you know, what we're doing isn't even close to that.

DETROW: So it seems like you're saying that the personal information being sucked up by TikTok is happening, but your point is that this happens on Facebook. This happens on Instagram. This happens on Twitter as well. And I see that. But there's the specific question here with TikTok of the Chinese government and its interactions with the company. What's your response to that?

POCAN: They haven't shown us anything yet to say that's being done, right? Normally, we would have classified briefing or some sort of briefing if that was the case. That hasn't happened. But you know, what is happening is Congress, the average age, I think, is 57.5. And if you asked, I would guess somewhere between 80 and 90% of members have never been on TikTok, but they certainly have lots of opinions. And this week, I think we had a relatively cringeworthy hearing where members, you know, asked questions about, does TikTok access your internet and, you know, is the leader of China your boss and all sorts of other really crazy questions, which is what often happens is, you know, on a lot of different technology issues, you know, members of Congress, especially, you know, on some of these committees, are not probably the most well versed on these issues.

DETROW: Yes.

POCAN: The reality, though, is there is a real problem out there. And, you know, I think some of the antitrust subcommittee work on judiciary has been actually trying to get at going after some of these social media giants. The problem is, in order to go after all of them, you have to go after a lot of lobbyists in Washington. You got to go after some of the richest people in the country, who, by the way, happened to contribute to both Democrats and Republicans. And that makes it tougher. So in trying to act like we're addressing the problem, I think a lot of people are just missing the target and saying, let's go after TikTok because maybe, possibly, they could do this. And if they were actually right, then we should have questions about why we're making phones or computers in China, why we have cloud services out of China.

DETROW: You did mention lobbyists. I do want to ask, have you had conversations with TikTok, which is certainly mounting a lobbying campaign as it comes under this pressure?

POCAN: No. In fact, what's funny is my office has just heard me complaining about this because, you know, I have to be one of the people who's one of 150 million people that is a consumer of TikTok. But there certainly is an issue about how they deal with our data and privacy and in pushing certain content. And I'm not saying that we see that coming out of TikTok, but we see that coming out of social media in general. Those are real issues that we should be able to, in a bipartisan way, address. And some of this, unfortunately, I think falls into the category of xenophobia.

DETROW: You did say a lot of the deep concerns at the heart of this are hypothetical. At this point, there's not clear evidence. But TikTok did admit that employees in China accessed the personal data of some U.S. journalists who were reporting on company leaks. Was that specific issue - which again, TikTok did admit - concerning to you?

POCAN: Anytime they're misusing - any social media platform is misusing or, without our knowledge, doing some work with data, it should concern everyone.

DETROW: You're a top progressive. A lot of younger progressive voters use TikTok every single day. I mean, what do you think the real-world response would be if this ever was somehow banned? I mean, you're talking about the fact that a lot of lawmakers are not, you know, deeply connected to this platform, but millions and millions of younger Americans are.

POCAN: Yeah. I mean, then that's the disconnect. In fact, you know, even younger members - I got to admit, I had a conversation with a younger member who's like kind of giving some of the rhetoric that bluntly comes out of some of the paid organizing efforts by some of the other companies that are out there trying to, you know, paint TikTok in a certain way. And I finally said to the person, have you ever been on TikTok? And they said, no. And I just find it fascinating how, you know, people have so many opinions about something that they've never even taken a look at. We should do something about social media platforms and privacy of data and the pushing of disinformation. That should be something...

DETROW: What would you do, though? Because...

POCAN: You bring in...

DETROW: ...Information is that the heart of so many of these social media companies.

POCAN: Sure.

DETROW: So what's the fix?

POCAN: What we need to do is figure out exactly how the platforms are collecting data and how they use it and how they're using brokers and how they're pushing some of the disinformation that we know exists, and then figure out some policy around that that protects consumers so that you can still have an online platform, which is the reality of where we are in 2023 America or, for that matter, of the world. But you can do it in a way that protects consumers.

DETROW: Isn't there a broader problem here that the people who run this country don't seem to understand a core part of its economy?

POCAN: We do need to have outsiders sometimes present some of that expertise to Congress so that we can actually get our handle on it. I mean, we're not the fastest-moving entity, right? I think sloths sometimes watch Congress and ask why we're moving so slowly. This is one of those issues that we just don't have the expertise. We need to get that in. We need to bring these companies in. And we can't be persuaded by lobbyists or, for that matter, rich individuals who own some of these other platforms or affiliated with them, that we ignore their platform, but we'll look at a different one.

DETROW: Sloths move faster than the Congress. Slots also make good social media content, usually, I've found.

POCAN: I think you're right. I think you're right.

DETROW: That's Congressman Mark Pocan. Congressman Pocan, thanks so much for joining us.

POCAN: Absolutely. Thank you.

2023-03-26,2023-03-25 20:54:36,Cordon-Ragot alarmed as Zaaf could be forced to use bank guarantee to pay salaries,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/we-cant-work-for-free-cordon-ragot-alarmed-as-zaaf-could-be-forced-to-use-bank-guarantee-to-pay-salaries/,Technology,"French Champion Audrey Cordon-Ragot has spoken out about the Zaaf Cycling Team, confirming the allegations that management has not paid riders and staff salaries since January 1, 2023.

The Spanish-registered women's team is currently under investigation by the UCI and the Spanish Cycling Federation as the sport governing bodies seek to clarify the team's financial situation and, if necessary, execute the bank guarantee to compensate riders and staff.

""Things are in place with the responsible entities to recover our money, but we have not been paid since January 1 nor reimbursed for our travel expenses. We are in conditions that are not worthy of a pro team, and it is very complicated to exercise our profession, even if we have been doing it since January 1,"" Cordon-Ragot said in an interview with Ouest-France (opens in new tab).

sZaaf Cycling Team stepped in to hire some of the riders left without a contract following the collapse of the B&B Hotels-KTM squad last December, bringing in riders Audrey Cordon-Ragot, Maggie Coles-Lyster and Heidi Franz on last-minute contract deals to its 15-rider roster.

A club team in 2021, Zaaf Cycling Team management took the steps to upgrade to a UCI Continental Team for the first time this season. Its riders have competed in a full calendar of races beginning at the Australian summer season of racing at the Tour Down Under and Cadel Evans Road Race, then went on to race the early-season events in Spain and the beginning of the spring Classics.

Zaaf Cycling Team riders have placed in the top 10 at 14 events this year so far, with Zayed Ahmed winning double national titles at Egypt's National Championships.

Allegations of the team not compensating its riders and staff surfaced in March following reports by journalists Charles Marsault and Raul Banqueri. Cordon-Ragot later confirmed that have not been paid for the previous three months of work completed.

""They promise to pay us. But it's been the same thing every week for nearly three months. We don't see the money coming, and we can't live without it, clearly. I wonder what I'm going to do. It is complicated,"" Cordon-Ragot said.

""The option that has been put forward, if we are not paid before the end of March, is to operate the financial [bank] guarantee that had been paid to the Spanish Federation, and which would at least allow us to be compensated, but only three months' salary.

""So that's why we can't wait much longer. Because if we go another month without being paid, and we call on this bank guarantee at the end of April, we will have a month that will not be covered by this guarantee. And we will have worked for a month on a voluntary basis... I can't work for free for another three months.""

Cyclingnews has contacted the Zaaf Cycling Team to clarify the team's financial situation, but the team has not responded.

The Spanish Cycling Federation has confirmed to Cyclingnews that it is aware of the allegations that have been lodged against the Zaaf Cycling Team, confirming that it has received documentation, which it will utilise to show proof that some of the team's riders and staff have not been paid. It also confirmed that if the riders and staff are not properly compensated, it will seek to execute and draw on the team's bank guarantee on March 31, 2024.

Under the current regulations, a federation cannot access a bank guarantee for one year from the point that the riders and staff stopped being compensated, however, The Cyclists' Alliance (TCA) has told Cyclingnews that it is working with the UCI and the Spanish Cycling Federation to try and open the bank guarantee sooner.

Cordon-Ragot said she is not angry with Zaaf Cycling Team and currently believes that the management is struggling with a logistical problem that is preventing it from accessing the funds needed to pay its riders and staff from the specified bank account. She said the team is working to try to find a solution to the issue.

""I'm starting to despair a bit,"" she said. ""If the team doesn't quickly find a solution, I don't see how it will be possible to continue. It's not just the riders, the staff isn't paid either. At some point, it's not viable.""

Cordon-Ragot suffered a stroke ahead of the World Championships last September and then was part of the group of riders left without a contract when the B&B Hotels team suddenly collapsed.

""It's a lot… It's one more hassle. Afterwards, once again, I really have in front of me honest people who want to get out of it. So it's different; they are not people who talk nonsense. The problem is that, at some point, solutions have to be found.""

It has been reported that the riders from Zaaf Cycling Team have discussed not taking the start line at Sunday's Gent-Wevelgem, and perhaps not competing until the financial situation is resolved, indicating that they cannot continue to work without being properly compensated according to their contracts.

Co-founder of TCA, Iris Slappendel, told Cyclingnews that the riders understandably feel that they need to prioritise their working conditions over racing until a resolution is in place.

""From our understanding, the riders don't want to protest. But at this stage, there are other priorities for the riders than participating in a sporting competition,"" Slappendel said.

Cordon-Ragot stressed that she does not know what will happen next for Zaaf Cycling Team, and while it could stop competing for a while to sort out its financial situation, the team could continue to race at a later date.

""With this bank guarantee thing, it could stop the team for a while. This is why we hope that this monetary aspect will be settled quickly. [On Thursday, March 23, 2023] we were told another fortnight … There will be decisions to be made if nothing progresses in a few weeks,"" she said.

Asked if Cordon-Ragot might consider changing teams, she told Ouest-France, ""It's too early to tell. If I have to resign, I won't be able to race before June 1, so… These are decisions that will have to be made. But it can taint the rest of my season, that's clear."""

Tesla Giga Berlin has reached an annual run rate of 260,000 vehicles, the company confirmed.

Tesla officially announced that its factory outside of Berlin built 5,000 vehicles in a week this past week, just one year after starting deliveries to European customers.

Giga Berlin hits 5k builds/week—1 year after delivering the first vehicles to customers pic.twitter.com/PZigSaSci5 — Tesla (@Tesla) March 25, 2023

The growth of Tesla’s Giga Berlin factory is remarkable, considering less than a month ago, the automaker announced that it reached a run rate of 4,000 vehicles per week, well ahead of schedule.

Considering Tesla just celebrated the factory’s one-year anniversary earlier this week, the growth and ramp-up of Tesla’s first vehicle production facility in Europe have been imperative to the company’s success in the region.

Europe is one of the most competitive markets for electric vehicles, and it was long dominated by companies that have long called the region home. Volkswagen was the company that had the most sales by manufacturer before Tesla came into the region with Giga Berlin.

Prior to Tesla’s construction and kick-off of production and deliveries from the factory, it exported vehicles from Giga Shanghai, its Chinese production facility, and brought them into the continent to support demand.

Tesla is likely ramping production at an accelerated rate in Berlin as it continues its end-of-quarter push, which is somewhat traditional for the automaker as it attempts to push as many deliveries as it can to establish quarter-over-quarter growth.

Pictures from @wolfpackberlin (via @Berlinergy) show that Tesla lots around Giga Berlin are full of vehicles that are being prepared for customer deliveries.

These vehicles will be delivered to German customers, and others in surrounding areas as the automaker continues to pad its Q1 2023 delivery statistics.

Registration data tracked by EU-EVs shows Tesla has dominated 2023 thus far. Tesla has sold 36,036 vehicles thus far, owning 19.5 percent of the European market thus far. Volkswagen is in second, and its 21,552 sales account for 11.7 percent of the total market.

Tesla is also planning to expand production at Giga Berlin to reach one million vehicles per year, and it submitted its application for the expansion earlier in March.

2023-03-26,2023-03-25 19:00:00,Aboriginal Art Is Booming in Australia. Inside the Galleries and Museums Spotlighting First Nation Works.,https://robbreport.com/shelter/art-collectibles/museums-galleries-spotlighting-aboriginal-art-1234817997/,Technology,"When a flash flood sent a five-foot wave sweeping through the Mitchelton Gallery of Aboriginal Art last fall, curator Adam Knight helicoptered in to rescue what he could. The subterranean gallery—part of a luxury resort in the middle of a Victoria winery that’s a 90-minute drive north of Melbourne—is no glorified gift shop, but rather the largest commercial space in Australia devoted to work by First Nations artists. “I had to go myself—I knew what the masterpieces were,” he says. “There were moments when I thought I was going to drown while trying to save some of the key pieces.”

Knight’s rescue mission salvaged over 100 works, but more than 300 were destroyed. His determination reflects Aboriginal art’s newfound status both in Australia and in the larger art world.

Ignored as little more than the stuff of souvenirs for decades, it has now taken seriously by collectors and curators alike. Politically, First Nations issues are on par with the Black Lives Matter movement, and culturally, contemporary Indigenous artists’ works typically reference the desert where their communities have lived for thousands of years, as well as such rituals and traditions as the coming-of-age walkabout. The paintings’ pulsating lines, concentric circles and arrays of dots often resemble Western-style minimalism or abstract expressionism.

“Painting is always a process, and in our culture, age brings transition and new knowledge, but for me it is always connected to land. It is sacred,” says artist Daniel Walbidi. “As I get older, the elders pass new teachings; these are the things that influence my work the most, my understanding of my culture.”

Citing Walbidi, Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Yukultji Napangati and Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri, Melbourne gallerist D’Lan Davidson says, “There can be no doubt that in the last century, First Nations Australian artists have created some of the most spectacular and important contemporary art that this world has seen, or will ever see.” Generally speaking, the initial wave of First Nations artists became active in the 1960s, when the government forced Indigenous peoples to move to a settlement; many of today’s leading figures, such as Walbidi, were born in the ’80s or ’90s.

The market has been supercharged in just the past few years. Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn fell in love with Tjapaltjarri ’s work when she saw his large-scale pieces at Documenta 13 in 2012 and, after tracking him down in the Papunya-Tula community, gave him a show at her Salon 94 gallery in New York in 2015. “I was moved by his clear expression of abstract meditation and painting as ritual,” she says.

But the real spark came in 2019, when Gagosian mounted two shows of work by Aboriginal artists, in New York and Los Angeles, featuring pieces loaned by the actor Steve Martin, a major collector of contemporary art. Now, Davidson’s gallery, D’Lan Contemporary, is set to open a space on the Upper East Side in May; meanwhile, in London, the exhibition A Year in Art: Australia 1992, rooted in the British Supreme Court ruling that overturned the doctrine the British used to justify colonization, will be on view at Tate Modern through May 14.

Even in Australia, only relatively recently have these artists been given their due respect. When Archie Moore represents the country at the Venice Biennale next year, he will become just the second First Nations artist to be given the honor (the first was Tracey Moffatt in 2017). Some of the greats appear in the new SANAA-designed Sydney Modern Project’s Yiribana Gallery. Much of the topographical-style imagery hanging there has frequently been dismissed as folk art, a superficial reading that many curators would attribute to colonial prejudice. These aren’t simply ornate maps: Maria Josette Orsto’s diptych Miyinga jilamara (2008), for instance, uses the pwoja—an ironwood comb—to create rhythmic dots referencing ritual body scarification, and the result is fresh and bold.

When the Sydney Modern Project opened in December, its original site next door at the Art Gallery of New South Wales was showing the first major solo museum exhibition of Daniel Boyd, whose imagery deconstructs the colonial past. The work is about his family tree as much as it is about politics, and his technique employs thousands of translucent dots, or “lenses,” on his canvases, akin to pointillism. Though one of the biggest stars of his generation—the National Gallery of Australia snapped up all of his graduate work—Boyd reserves some of his best pieces for relatives, rejecting the idea of art as commodity.

Such reticence has not stopped collectors from acquiring works by other Aboriginal artists. Private equity investor Danny Goldberg, one of Australia’s most prolific collectors, started buying art in 1993 but only in the past decade discovered what’s on his doorstep. “One day, I was led through a world-class collection of Indigenous art and had a light-bulb moment—an explosion of vibrant colors, intricate designs and motifs backed by stories and symbolism,” says Goldberg, whose collection now includes pieces by Walbidi and Mantua Nangala, among other First Nations artists.

Halfway around the world, collector Lonti Ebers, a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, focuses on underappreciated but important artists, including several First Nations practitioners. “The one painting I have by Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjarri hangs in our London home amongst the work of several of the best international artists of today,” she says. “It effortlessly rivals the attention and interest accorded its companion pieces.”

The time has come for these artists from down under to land on top."

Elon Musk has been listed as a Featured Speaker for the 2023 POSSIBLE Event hosted by NBC Universal.

Musk will join Linda Yaccarino of NBCUniversal on April 18 in Miami to discuss Twitter and how it will shape marketers, culture, and other conversations.

Musk will also discuss the role Twitter, the social media platform he purchased last year, plays in cultural conversations.

The event will be called “Twitter 2.0: From Conversations to Partnerships.”

Looking forward to it — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 25, 2023

Musk, who bought Twitter for $44 billion last year, aimed to make the social media platform an inclusive arena for free speech and has made numerous changes to the site since taking it over.

One of the most notable changes that Musk has spoken of is the neutrality that Twitter 2.0 has displayed with political parties. The Tesla CEO has always maintained that an ideal platform would make political figures from both sides would be equally upset.

“For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,” Musk said.

Along with Musk, other featured speakers include Jon Bon Jovi, LL Cool J, Alex Rodriguez, and a lineup of other experts in marketing, brand building, entrepreneurship, and communications.

Musk is commonly included in interesting events as a speaker. Most recently, he was a speaker at the 2023 World Government Summit in Dubai, where he discussed Twitter, Education, Social Media, and Artificial Intelligence.

In more terrible news from the tiny-bits-of-plastic front: a recent study from researchers at the Netherlands' Leiden University found that nanoplastics — particles even smaller than microplastics — cause absolutely horrid development problems in chicken embryos, leading to extensive malformations and birth defects in newborn chicks.

""Polystyrene nanoplastics cause a wide spectrum of severe congenital malformations in the chick embryo,"" the scientists write in the study, published this month in the journal Environment International.

""We provide the first evidence,"" the added, ""that nanoplastics cause severe defects in the heart and great vessels.""

The harrowing study comes at a pivotal moment for human society, during which we attempt to grapple with what the ever-growing omnipresence of microplastics — which have been discovered everywhere from the most remote parts of Antarctica to the human bloodstream, and even newborn human babies — means for the environment, as well as for our own bodies (thus far, none of it is good.)

To conduct the study, the researchers manually injected hefty amounts of tiny plastic particles into the embryos. And then, put very simply, they sat back and watched the plastics do their thing.

The scientists were able to observe as the particles traveled through the cellular membrane, settling into various embryonic organs. The real trouble, however, came when the scientists realized that the nanoparticles were sticking to the chicks' neural crest cells, a type of stem cell that starts in the spinal cord, but migrates to help form critical parts of the body, including the heart and arteries, the nervous system, facial features, and more.

In an alarming turn, the researchers realized that the plastics were actually trapping those neural crest cells in the spine — meaning that the important stem cells couldn't travel to where they needed to go, and thus, those parts of the body couldn't form properly.

""Neural crest cells are sticky,"" Michael Richardson, a developmental biologist at Leiden University and a study coauthor, said in a university press release, ""so nanoparticles can adhere to them and thereby disrupt organs that depend on these cells for their development.""

""I like the metaphor of making dough. When making bread, for example, you put flour on it to make it not sticky anymore,"" he continued. ""However, in this case, it ruins the migration of the neural crest cells.""

""We see malformations in the nervous system, heart, eyes and other parts of the face,"" added Meiru Wang, a researcher at the university and another study coauthor.

Importantly, the scientists did inject the chicks with some seriously extreme levels of nanoparticles, with Wang explaining in the press release that the levels used to conduct the study ""would normally not be present in an organism.""

But still, that's just what's normal today. Scientists are constantly finding microplastics in new and alarming places, from the depths of the ocean to the human placenta. And as Science Alert points out, if plastic use doesn't slow down, we should expect the world environment to hold 900 million tons of microplastics by 2025 — double what that number was in 2018.

And ultimately, says Wang in the press release, their findings, if still somewhat pre-emptive, show ""what nano-plastics can do in extreme cases on very young embryos.""

The study also ""gives us guidelines on what can happen less severely,"" she added, ""in the developmental stage.""

This Week’s Summary

The crypto market ends the week at a total market capitalization of $1,165 trillion.

Bitcoin is up by over 2% after a rollercoaster of a week.

Ethereum decreased by almost 1% over the past seven days.

XRP gained more than 15% in value this week.

Almost all altcoins are trading in the green, with very few exceptions.

The DeFi sector decreased the total value of protocols (TVL) to around $49 billion.

Crypto Trends 20 – 26 March 2023: Market Analysis and Performance

The crypto market continues to perform spectacularly despite the horrific disasters in other financial markets, such as the banking sector. Another major scare shocked the banking world this week when UBS saved former giant Credit Suisse from bankruptcy for almost $3.3 billion.

The news rippled in volatility waves across the financial landscape. Nevertheless, it barely rocked the crypto boat as only a handful of assets seesawed slightly for a few hours. Most of them returned in the green before the weekend began. Meanwhile, the market capitalization dropped by around $20 billion but remained firmly above the $1.1 trillion level.

Bitcoin started the week really well, surging to almost $29,000 at one point. The banking sector debacle affected it for nearly a day, causing a $2,000 loss. However, the crypto king quickly recovered and sprung back to $28,000, where it is still trading momentarily.

Ethereum did not manage to recover as fast as BTC from the lousy news traveling through the crypto market. The second crypto in command lost around $200 of its trading value, less than 1%. In fact, it is now trading in the red at around $1,770. However, it will likely pick up in the coming days.

Altcoins & DeFi

Almost all the altcoins are trading in the green and boasting significant increases. For example, XRP is up by 15% and getting closer to the $0.5 price again. Meanwhile, Cardano is up by 5%, Dogecoin by 1%, Litecoin by 12%, and Chainlink by 2%.

Not everything is rosy for the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. For instance, BNB is down by 4%, Polygon by 7%, Solana by 3%, and Polkadot by 6%. The same goes for Shiba Inu, TRON, and Avalanche, each down by around 3%.

The Metaverse sector does not share the same sentiment as the rest of the crypto market. For instance, Theta Network is down by 3%, Axie Infinity by 8%, and Decentraland by 7%. Meanwhile, ApeCoin decreased by 4%, ICP by almost 8%, and The Sandbox by 7%. Last week’s surprising overachiever, Stacks, is coming down from a 100% high with a 12% drop in value.

The DeFi sector lost nearly $0.5 billion from the total value in locked protocols (TVL), now at almost $49.82 billion.

The Sun during day, and the Moon and stars that occupy the fabric of our night. Our bodies and minds developed around the day-night rhythm, with the day providing for most of our needs and night, critically, signaling our biological systems that it was time to restore itself in advance of the next day. For most life on Earth, night is a critical resource. For millennia, we developed in harmony with nature and with the day-night cycle. Not long ago, a person could have stepped outside their Fargo area home, looked up and been in awe of the night sky.

No more. With electric lighting, we have turned our world into 24/7 daylight. Today, the Milky Way is barely visible from nearby Buffalo River State Park, and not at all from inside Fargo. Research published in the journal “Science” shows that light pollution has risen dramatically, nearly 10% per year, over the last dozen years.

Artificial light at night and the light pollution it creates is a contributor to numerous issues:



Energy waste: Up to 30% of lighting is “wasted,” not illuminating its subject, leading to $3.3 billion in costs and releasing up to 21 million tons of carbon dioxide per year.

Birds have migrations and mating seasons disrupted, insect life is affected, nocturnal mammals can be drawn into dire situations and suffer health impacts and even plants can see their seasonal patterns effected. Agriculture is affected as well: Light pollution is known to delay maturation and reduce crop yield of soybeans and can disrupt the circadian rhythm of cows, contributing to fatty liver and reduced milk production. Sunflowers are heliotropic, with the stems and leaves being responsive to sunlight. They display a circadian rhythm as well. Artificial light at night possibly influences their growth.

Loss of awe and wonder: Four out of five people in the U.S. live under skies so polluted they can no longer see the Milky Way and 99% of us live under light polluted skies that limit our experience of the dark sky heritage that connects us all.

What can be done? The International Dark-Sky Association and Illuminating Engineering Society’s five principles of outdoor lighting are a good place to start, stating that lighting should be as follows:

Useful: All light should have a clear purpose.

All light should have a clear purpose. Targeted: Light should be directed only where needed.

Light should be directed only where needed. Low light levels: Light should be no brighter than necessary.

Light should be no brighter than necessary. Controlled: Light should be used only when useful.

Light should be used only when useful. Color: Use warmer color lights where possible.

Governments and business can incorporate these principles in their lighting plans. Cities can work on comprehensive lighting ordinances addressing artificial light at night as a pollutant. And we can look at our own homes.

International Dark-Sky Week is April 15 to 22 this year, coinciding with Earth Day on April 22. Let’s focus this month on learning about the nighttime environment, how light pollution influences it and decide that restoring the night is a goal for a healthier, happier and more resilient Fargo-Moorhead.

2023-03-26,2023-03-26 10:47:00,How the diversion project saved money by buying grain elevators and a rail spur in Horace it doesn't need,https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/how-the-diversion-project-saved-money-by-buying-grain-elevators-and-a-rail-spur-in-horace-it-doesnt-need,Top,"HORACE — The Metro Flood Diversion Authority is now the improbable owner of former CHS grain elevators and more than two miles of abandoned railroad track that once served the storage facility.

The elevators, which dominate the skyline of this farming town turned suburban community, now stand empty — and the town’s mayor has his eyes on the property with the possibility of repurposing the landmark.

The unusual purchase was part of a workaround to prevent the need to build a costly railroad bridge to cross the 30-mile diversion channel, a move that will save $7.9 million to $8.8 million, according to diversion officials.

If the purchase and agreements involving the design and construction of three other railroad bridges hadn’t gone through, the metro flood-control project could have faced costly and lengthy delays that could have jeopardized the $3.2 billion project’s scheduled 2027 completion date.

City officials in Horace, aware the sale of the elevators was pending and they no longer would be in use, had preliminary discussions of preserving the towering vestiges of the towns agricultural roots.

“We’ve talked about it,” said Horace Mayor Kory Peterson. “People in town have different ideas.”

Suggestions included using the elevator site, which includes office buildings, to house a microbrewery, coffee shop or distillery.

While some might see the elevators as drab metal hulks, Peterson sees them as integral to Horace’s farming legacy.

“It has been an icon of the city for years,” he said. “We’d kind of like to see if we could preserve it.”

The Metro Flood Diversion Authority now owns the grain elevator in Horace and a stretch of abandoned railroad that once served the facility. Buying the elevator and paying for the expansion of the elevator in Kindred enabled the authority to save $8 million by avoiding the need to build a railroad bridge across the diversion channel David Samson / The Forum

Other communities in the region have done creative makeovers of retired grain elevators and feed sheds, including one in western Montana that now serves as a microbrewery with an interior adorned with historic photos.

“It’s very unique,” Peterson said. “It’s kind of like preserving the history of the town.”

Similarly, a former elevator and feed shed in Chaska, Minnesota, has been converted into a restaurant.

“It was very well done,” he said. “You really went back in history when you ate there.”

But city officials haven’t yet answered basic questions, including potential renovation costs, in the event the Diversion Authority would be willing to transfer the property. They have been waiting for the acquisition, which closed on Wednesday, March 22, to be completed.

“We didn’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves,” Peterson said.

The purchase of the Horace elevators and agreements involving the three railroad bridges are the result of lengthy negotiations with BNSF Railway, said Joel Paulsen, the Diversion Authority’s executive director.

“We’ve been working with BNSF for five or six years to get this all resolved,” he said.

The former CHS elevators in Horace were the only railroad customer on a 2.35-mile spur rail line, and that spur was only used a couple times each year.

It was cheaper for the Diversion Authority to buy the elevators and rail bed right-of-way — and to pay for added storage to the CHS-Dakota Plains Ag elevator in Kindred — than to build a railroad bridge that would receive such limited use, Paulsen said.

“That prevented us from having to build a $17 million bridge,” including operation and maintenance costs, he said.

Associated expenses included $1.2 million to acquire right-of-way from BNSF, $3.6 million to the Red River Valley & Western Railroad for operating rights and abandonment fees for the track segment and $3.1 million to CHS to expand capacity at its Kindred elevator.

If the railroad bridge issues hadn’t been resolved, a report for project lenders estimated completion of the Red River diversion could have been delayed by as much as about 280 days.

As a result of the agreements and the purchase of the Horace elevators, the diversion project remains on schedule, with completion in time to allow it to operate in the spring of 2027.

“Right now, we’re still on track,” said John Shockley, a lawyer for the Diversion Authority who was involved in the painstaking negotiations.

ASN Constructors, which is building the diversion channel, and associated public works could have faced “acceleration costs” of $23 million, according to a report by Altus Group, which is monitoring progress on the project for lenders.

The Red River Valley Alliance, the consortium behind the project in partnership with the Diversion Authority, could have faced additional costs of $12.7 million.

Those potential delays and additional costs have been avoided because the bridge issues have been resolved, Paulsen and an executive with the Red River Valley Alliance said.

“I’m happy to report we were able to mitigate that issue,” Paulsen said. One way of making up time is to have simultaneous reviews of the railroad bridges, both from the perspective of the authority’s flood-protection needs and those of BNSF.

“So, you have really two sets of eyes looking at it,” Shockley said.

BNSF wanted the three railroad bridges to have the capability of adding a second set of tracks in the future and wanted to have ownership and control of the bridges — conditions that were accepted in an agreement signed in January, Paulsen said.

Besides the three railroad crossings of the diversion channel, the project also required multiple agreements with the North Dakota Department of Transportation and utilities for crossings.

The Diversion Authority has reached more than 30 utility agreements to cross the channel, including pipelines and wires, with a similar number involving the 20-mile embankment.

“There’s a whole host of utilities that cross,” Shockley said.

A decision about what to do with the abandoned elevators and rail segment will be up to the Diversion Authority board. The property is of no use to the flood project, he said.

“We are not a rail company or a grain handling company,” Shockley said."
2023-03-26,2023-03-26 10:00:00,John Wheeler: So many factors other than snow accumulation affect spring flooding,https://www.inforum.com/weather/john-wheeler-so-many-factors-other-than-snow-accumulation-affect-spring-flooding,Top,"FARGO — The point has been made in this space many times that the total winter snow accumulation does not relate particularly well to the severity of the spring flood. The water content in the snowpack, which is not necessarily related to the depth of the snow, is a far better indicator. Also very important is any heavy precipitation, particularly rain, during or shortly before the main melt, as well as the rate of melt.

Also, the weather in other places can bring unexpected changes. Red River tributaries include the Otter Tail and Red Lake, which arrive from the east; the Bois De Sioux, which comes up from the south; the Wild Rice, which brings water from the south; and the Sheyenne, which drains a large area of southeast and central North Dakota. Varying amounts of water and differences in timing from these sub-basins can all impact the flooding downstream."
2023-03-26,2023-03-26 09:07:00,Another I-94 exit in the works for West Fargo,https://www.inforum.com/news/west-fargo/another-i-94-exit-in-the-works-for-west-fargo,Top,"WEST FARGO — The city of West Fargo could get an additional Interstate 94 exit at 26th Street West, west of the fairgrounds.

The West Fargo City Commission recently voted unanimously to have staff negotiate with the developer of the Sandhills Sixth Addition to purchase a portion of the development in order to secure the city's right-of-way should an interchange be built.

""I think it's absolutely essential to have this project to improve the connectivity,"" Commissioner Mandy George said.

City Engineer Dan Hanson said it's an opportunity for city staff to look into the future, especially when it comes to the Sandhills lots. He said 26th Street West has been identified as a future major north-south corridor for the city as it expands.

Hanson said part of the 132,000 square foot parcel could be donated by the developer, who is willing to sell the remainder of the land needed to the city.

""If the city chooses not to purchase the land, it will be platted and developed within the Sandhills Sixth Addition project and when the interchange is constructed in the future, it is likely that the city would need to purchase this land from businesses at a potentially considerably higher cost,"" Hanson said in a memo to the City Commission.

If an interchange is constructed in the area, it would be done by the North Dakota Department of Transportation, Hanson said. However, without having the right-of-way, it would likely be more difficult to urge NDDOT to move forward with such a project.

Hanson said a recent Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan Council of Governments (Metro COG) study found it's possible that 13th Avenue could also one day have an interchange at I-94 as the street stretches into far western West Fargo."
2023-03-26,2023-03-26 09:06:00,Marathon bankruptcy case involving defunct ND horse betting firm crossing finish line,https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/marathon-bankruptcy-case-involving-defunct-nd-horse-betting-firm-crossing-finish-line,Top,"FARGO — The trustee in the bankruptcy case of Racing Services Inc. (RSI), a defunct horse betting operation based in Fargo, has submitted a final report in U.S. Bankruptcy Court outlining how the estate was liquidated and where it's approximately $16.8 million in assets wound up.

According to the report, which appears to wrap up the bankruptcy case once and for all:

About $7 million of estate assets were distributed to RSI and its owner, Susan Bala.

About $5.6 million went to Chapter 7 administrative fees and charges and approximately $2.7 million went to PW Enterprises, a large gambler that used RSI for off-track betting.

Disbursements to PW Enterprises included the firm's initial bankruptcy claim of $2.2 million as well as additional miscellaneous unsecured claims.

ADVERTISEMENT

The rest of the money dispersed went to pay off the estate's remaining unsecured claims.

It appears the payments will put to rest legal wrangling that extended back to 2004, when RSI bankruptcy proceedings began.

In the years that followed, RSI and Bala, the company's founder, were at the center of numerous legal proceedings, both civil and criminal.

Some of those legal proceedings came to a head in 2014, when a federal judge ruled that the state of North Dakota wasn't authorized to collect taxes on account wagering, a form of gambling that utilized services like RSI.

As part of that issue, the state of North Dakota agreed to pay about $15.8 million to RSI's bankruptcy estate and its sole owner, Bala.

The state wired the funds to the RSI estate trust account in early 2018, where the money, along with other miscellaneous receipts collected by the estate, would languish while legal fighting continued.

One aspect of that ongoing fighting stemmed from early in RSI's bankruptcy case when a large creditor — PW Enterprises — amended its original claim of $2.2 million, increasing what it sought from the estate by about $10.8 million.

In November 2018, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court denied PWE's amended claim, but approved PWE's initial $2.2 million claim. PWE appealed the decision, claiming it was entitled to money North Dakota paid to the bankruptcy estate. In the alternative, PWE said, money returned to RSI from North Dakota should go to charities.

ADVERTISEMENT

The state of North Dakota filed a brief in support of PWE's appeal, but later withdrew the brief. PWE's appeal was ultimately dismissed in June 2020.

In late December 2018 — about a year after the state of North Dakota and the RSI bankruptcy estate settled for about $15.8 million — the state filed a fresh claim against the estate on behalf of nonprofit groups. PWE filed a brief in support of the state's claim.

An evidentiary hearing was held on the state's new claim in May of 2019.

During that hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Thad Collins learned an agreement had existed between the state and PWE since about December 2018 that called for the state to split any proceeds it recovered for charity with PWE.

Series of appeals

In January 2020, Collins issued a ruling denying the state's new claim against the RSI bankruptcy estate, a claim specifically made on behalf of just one nonprofit group — Team Makers, the fundraising arm for the North Dakota State University athletic department.

The state appealed that ruling to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, and PWE sought to join the state in that appeal.

In September 2020, the appellate panel issued a ruling that partly affirmed and partly reversed Collins' January 2020 ruling.

The appellate panel's decision sent the case back to Collins, who was tasked with again ruling on the state's new claim on behalf of Team Makers, though this time the bankruptcy judge was to decide the claim on its merits and not its timeliness.

ADVERTISEMENT

The bankruptcy judge was also obliged to rule on an amended claim the state brought during the May 2019 evidentiary hearing on the state's new claim, with the amended claim asserting breach of contract against RSI on behalf of Team Makers.

In a decision handed down in April of 2021, Collins ruled against both of the claims the state brought against the RSI bankruptcy estate on behalf of Team Makers.

The state of North Dakota appealed that ruling, but in January 2022 the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel upheld Collins' ruling, which at this point appears to have put the RSI bankruptcy matter to rest.

In its January 2022 ruling, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel stated: ""The bankruptcy court insisted that this marathon litigation must end, and we agree. The time to reach a final adjudication on claims is long overdue.""

'A simple question'

In a written statement provided to The Forum, Bala echoed that sentiment, stating many people have asked her what it feels like to see legal matters connected to RSI coming to a final resolution.

The question, she said, leaves her searching for words.

""It seems a simple question, but it represents a complex, deeply difficult and life changing 20 years,"" said Bala, who in 2007 walked out of a federal prison after serving more than 500 days for her conviction on charges that had alleged she was part of an illegal gambling operation.

Her prison term ended early after a federal appeals court overturned her conviction and a federal judge entered an order acquitting Bala and RSI of criminal charges. In its ruling overturning Bala's convictions, the appeals court stated the government had ""failed to prove any of the offenses charged.""

ADVERTISEMENT

Since then, Bala has twice sought and twice failed to secure a certificate of innocence. Such a certificate is necessary if someone wants to seek damages through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for unjust imprisonment or conviction.

Now, as RSI's brankruptcy case winds up, Bala said her thoughts are focused on what it feels like ""to not have to get up every day — every single day as I have for the past 20 years — to have the weight, the oppression, the court deadlines, the mental and physical demands, the financial strain, the fight to get the facts and the law heard ... come to a halt.""

Bala said it seems to her like a war was waged on her personally and it will take time to distill the experience into words, though she stressed she is deeply thankful for those who came forward in critical times and who gave her their support.

""My sense of gratitude to see the truth win and to have survived it, supersedes all. Truly, faith got me through and got me here,"" Bala added.

She said she still mourns the destruction of a business and an industry she says were ""unique and substantial contributors to the state of North Dakota and that could have done so much more for the industry and the state.""

Bala added that she has been presented with a number of interesting business opportunities and she is ""figuring out how to create a new life going forward and what that life could look like."""

The “Ripple and XRP may finally be for real” newsletter written by Fortune Chief Editor Jeff John Roberts is a follow-up to an article published by him in 2017. The 2017-dated article titled “Is Ripple for Real” was a result of his skepticism about the actual or unique solution that Ripple and XRP offer.

Per the Friday opinion piece, Roberts met with Ripple President Monica Long last week. He now believes the Silicon Valley tech company and XRP both have a standout selling point — On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services — that would guarantee their long-term successes irrespective of the SEC case outcome.

According to him, Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product where XRP is utilized for speedy and cheap cross-border settlements is a long-term value proposition for both the crypto solutions company and the XRP Ledger native token.

More so, he highlighted that the XRP Ledger native currency has a unique design and tokenomics compared to other cryptocurrencies than are either based on proof-of-stake or proof-of-work.

The Fortune Chief Editor wrote, “A big reason for this is that XRP, the token often associated with Ripple, is different from other cryptocurrencies. Unlike other blockchain projects, there has never been any mining or proof-of-stake mechanism. Instead, the XRP founders simply conjured 100 billion of the tokens out of thin air in 2012, and ever since people have been trying to figure out what the stuff is for.”

On these grounds, Roberts noted that XRP would soar over time with Ripple recording greater expansion despite the direction of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit.

“All of this is to say that Ripple, more than ever before, has figured out a long-term value proposition for both the company and XRP—and that it may be poised to succeed regardless of how its big court case turns out,” he concluded.

<

It bears mentioning that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple in 2020 over XRP. The securities watchdog charged the San Francisco-based cross-border payment firm for violating securities laws during their XRP initial sales. The SEC also claims that XRP is an unregistered security.

However, Ripple has brought forward many facts and defense concepts including the Fair Notice Defense to prove that XRP is similar to other crypto assets the SEC submits are not securities. The probable conclusion of the two-year-long legal battle is expected later this year as Ripple CEO and other pro-XRP lawyers remain optimistic about the outcome.

2023-03-26,2023-03-26 07:30:16,How Did Beethoven Die?,https://investrecords.com/how-did-beethoven-die/,Top,"Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer and pianist who is seen as the most important person in the history of Western music. As one of the best and most important classical composers in the West, he had to deal with going deaf at the age of 28 in order to build a repertoire of the best classical music.

But who is Beethoven, and why has the cause of his death been argued about in history? Let’s look into this more.

Beethoven

Beethoven was born in the city of Bonn in December 1970. He was the son of Johann van Beethoven and one of three of his seven siblings to live.

His talent for music was clear from a young age, and his father was his first teacher. Later, Christian Gottlob Neefe, a conductor, and composer taught Beethoven. In 1783, he wrote his first piece, a set of piano variations, with Neefe’s help.

Most people divide Beethoven’s career into three parts: the beginning, the middle, and the end. Most people think that until 1802, he was growing up and getting better at what he did.

Between 1802 and 1812, his middle period, which is often called heroic, was very different from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In his later years, from 1812 to 1827, he learned more about how music is made and how it makes people feel.

Some of his best-known works are his third (Eroica), fifth, sixth (Pastorale), and ninth (Choral) symphonies, as well as his eighth (Pathetique) and fourteenth (Moonlight) piano sonatas, two of his later piano concertos, his opera Fidelio, and the piano piece Für Elise.

But in 1801 Beethoven began to lose his hearing, and by 1814 he was totally deaf. Even though he was no longer able to perform in concerts, he kept making art. During this time, he wrote some of his best pieces.

Many of Beethoven’s best-known pieces, like his later symphonies, mature chamber music, and late piano sonatas, were written after 1810, when he was less involved in society.

He is thought to be one of the best classical composers in history. But he got sick and was sick for a long time, and he died at the age of 56. But what was the real reason he died? Let’s find out what happened that led to his death.

De Ligt won everyone’s hearts (and a truckload of chocolate) for that goal-line clearance against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League RO16.

If you need a refresher: Yann Sommer had a howler in the penalty box which left Vitinha a wide open goal only for De Ligt to deny him. According to Sommer, the season could have gone differently had De Ligt not got to that ball. “It could be, yes. We need that kind of push, to support each other. This spirit makes a big team. We need this energy. We had more of it (energy) than Paris,” Sommer said on that clearance (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).

A Las Vegas judge on Wednesday stood by his previous decision to recuse himself from presiding over former Raiders player Henry Ruggs’ fatal DUI case.

Last week, defense attorneys had asked Justice of the Peace Joe Bonaventure to further explain why he had withdrawn from presiding over the case. Bonaventure had said he didn’t believe he was required to explain himself but stated last week that he would review case law.

Bonaventure said Wednesday that he could not find a prior case that required him to further explain the recusal.

“Accordingly, the court will allow its prior recusal decision to stand,” he said.

Bonaventure ordered the case back to Justice of the Peace Harmony Letizia’s courtroom, where a preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 4.

Ruggs is facing charges of DUI, reckless driving and possession of a firearm while under the influence in connection with a fiery November 2021 crash that killed 23-year-old Tina Tintor and her dog.

The criminal case against Ruggs has bounced between different judges in Las Vegas Justice Court in recent weeks after challenges from defense attorneys.

The shuffling began when defense attorneys David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld argued that Ruggs was “singled out” when Justice of the Peace Ann Zimmerman moved to continue overseeing the DUI case in January despite Bonaventure taking over a DUI specialty court during routine judicial reassignments.

After a district judge reassigned the case, Bonaventure recused himself because of comments he made about the case while running for re-election last year and ordered the case to move to Letizia’s courtroom. Bonaventure had presided over Ruggs’ initial court appearance, when he set a $150,000 bail for Ruggs.

Defense attorneys filed another petition in District Court for the case to be moved back to Bonaventure, arguing that he did not thoroughly explain why he could not oversee the proceedings. District Judge Jennifer Schwartz, who moved the case back to Bonaventure’s courtroom for a follow-up hearing, has stated she would not force him to oversee the case.

Chesnoff and Schonfeld issued a statement via email after Bonaventure’s ruling Wednesday.

“We have now had an opportunity to review the Court’s written Order and we respectfully disagree that the Judge did not need to make factual representations as to the basis for his disqualification,” the statement read. “We have made our record in court.”

Ruggs is accused of driving up to 156 mph down a residential street seconds before the fatal crash. Prosecutors have said that after the crash his blood alcohol level was 0.16 percent, twice the legal limit for drivers in Nevada.

Defense attorneys last week also filed a motion again asking a judge to exclude the results of Ruggs’ blood alcohol test from evidence. As of Wednesday, a hearing has not been set for a judge to review the motion.

2023-03-22,2023-03-22 09:00:15,Baseball’s Unicorn Made the W.B.C. ‘Real’,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/sports/baseball/shohei-ohtani-world-baseball-classic.html,Sports,"MIAMI — He strode to the mound with purpose, 6-foot-4 and full of muscle, a relief pitcher unlike any other. Fresh from the bullpen, his uniform was already caked in dirt. Shohei Ohtani had put in a full day’s work by the ninth inning of the World Baseball Classic final on Tuesday, coming to bat four times, and now he was going to pitch.

This is how greatness looks, and the setting was appropriate: a ballpark on the site of the old Orange Bowl, where Joe Namath delivered on his guarantee to win the Super Bowl for the Jets in 1969.

That event was just three years old then, and Namath’s heroics helped establish it as a national spectacle. This was the fifth World Baseball Classic and the first with baseball’s superpowers, Japan and the United States, together at the end. The tournament, it is safe to say, is no longer taking off. It is in orbit."
2023-03-22,2023-03-22 05:51:23,2023 World Baseball Classic score: Japan holds off USA as Shohei Ohtani closes out team's third WBC title,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWJhc2ViYWxsLWNsYXNzaWMtc2NvcmUtamFwYW4taG9sZHMtb2ZmLXVzYS1hcy1zaG9oZWktb2h0YW5pLWNsb3Nlcy1vdXQtdGVhbXMtdGhpcmQtd2JjLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC9saXZlL9IBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWJhc2ViYWxsLWNsYXNzaWMtc2NvcmUtamFwYW4taG9sZHMtb2ZmLXVzYS1hcy1zaG9oZWktb2h0YW5pLWNsb3Nlcy1vdXQtdGVhbXMtdGhpcmQtd2JjLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC9saXZlL2FtcC8?oc=5,Sports,"Japan defeated Team USA 3-2 on Tuesday night to win the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Japan, who went undefeated throughout the tournament, has now won three WBC tournaments: 2006, 2009, and 2023. They remain the only nation to win multiple tournaments, though Team USA would have joined them with a victory.

The Americans pulled out to an early lead, as Phillies shortstop Trea Turner launched a solo home run in the second to put them up 1-0. Turner's home run happened to make some history on both, country and tournament-wide levels. We'll touch on that more below. For now, just enjoy the moving pictures:

Team USA's lead didn't stand for long. Japan third baseman Munetaka Murakami, who homered 56 times last season and who drove in the game-winning run against Mexico on Monday, hit his own solo home run in the third inning to even the score. Take a look at this monster mash:

Japan would later take a 2-1 lead on a Lars Nootbaar fielder's choice. They would extend it to 3-1 on another home run, this one by first baseman Kazuma Okamoto.

To close out the game, Japan's manager, Hideki Kuriyama, turned to two Major League Baseball aces. Padres right-hander Yu Darvish was first up, checking in for the eighth. He experienced some turbulence, surrendering a long home run to Phillies outfielder Kyle Schwarber, reducing Japan's lead to 3-2. Darvish also gave up a hit to Turner, but he worked around it.

Angels two-way star Shohei Ohtani, whose availability had been uncertain dating back to last week, took the reins for the ninth. He closed out the victory and ensured Japan's championship. He worked around a leadoff walk to Jeff McNeil, coercing a double-play ball from Mookie Betts to set up the matchup everyone wanted to see: against Angels teammate Mike Trout, in a battle of arguably the two best players in the world.

Ohtani and Trout worked to a full count, fittingly, with Ohtani securing a pair of swing and misses on 100 mph fastballs. Ohtani then struck out Trout with a slider away, securing the end of the game and the tournament.

Here are five other things to know about Japan's latest WBC championship.

1. Japan's other pitchers hold strong

Most of the attention will be on Ohtani and Darvish, or Murakami and Okamoto's home runs, but Japan can credit its win in large part to an overall strong effort from their pitching staff. Lefty Shota Imanaga began the contest, holding the Americans to one run on four hits over two innings. He was subsequently relieved by a concert of NPB arms: Shosei Togo, Hiroto Takahashi, Hiromi Itoh, and Taisei Ota. Those four combined to throw five innings, surrendering three hits and three walks, and striking out five batters.

2. Japan completes dominant run

Japan went 7-0 in the WBC, running the table in both pool and single-elimination play. They didn't just beat their opponents; they overmatched them. Japan outscored their foes by a combined 56-18 margin -- that is, for those without a calculator, an average of five-plus runs per contest. What's more is that Japan scored at least six runs in all but one of its games. Fittingly, the exception was Tuesday, when they plated only three runs.

3. Team USA falters with men on

The Americans didn't want for opportunities to match or overtake Japan. On the night, they went 0 for 7 with runners in scoring position. That resulted in nine total runners left on base. Several of the Americans' best bats -- Nolan Arenado, Turner, Schwarber, and Mookie Betts -- stranded runners on base with two outs. Had one or two of them converted, the game would've had a different outcome. Alas, that wasn't meant to be the case.

4. Turner makes history

We mentioned in the introduction that Turner's home run, his fifth of the tournament, had historical significance. For starters, he established a new record for the most career home runs hit by an American batter in WBC history. He also tied the overall most home runs in a single tournament. That distinction had previously belonged to Korea's Seung-Yuop Lee, who had homered five times as part of the 2006 event. Adrián Beltré (Dominican Republic, 2006) and Wladimir Balentien (Netherlands, 2017) ranked third and fourth with four home runs apiece during those respective tournaments.

5. Next WBC coming in 2026

Prior to the game, Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred confirmed that the next edition of the WBC will take place in 2026. The tournament tends to have a cadence of every four years, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a seven-year gap. The decision to host another WBC in 2026 likely stems from it marking 20 years since the first tournament. You can find out which 16 countries have already qualified for entry by clicking here. Oh and by the way, Angels outfielder Mike Trout has already agreed to partake.

MIAMI — Shohei Ohtani did not jog in from the bullpen like most closers. His pants were already muddied, which isn’t the norm for relievers, either. Besides, a call was being reviewed so there was no rush. He did not exactly need one more run to get warm after eight innings serving as the designated hitter, a few of which he spent running from the bullpen to the dugout and back.

Mike Trout did not hurry to the on-deck circle. He, too, took his time. He, like all 36,098 in LoanDepot Park — like any baseball fan who ever dreamed up impossible matchups — had already had plenty of time to contemplate this moment: Ohtani vs. Mike Trout, Americans down one run, with two outs in the ninth inning of the World Baseball Classic final.

“Did you think it was going to end any other way?” Trout said afterward.

Ohtani did not even look at Trout when it was over, when his Los Angeles Angels teammate swung through a slider on a full count that secured Japan’s 3-2 victory Tuesday night. He threw his arms wide, then threw his glove aside as the undisputed champion of the baseball world — as though the greatest two-way player in a century had not held the title already.

“I believe this is the best moment in my life,” Ohtani said afterward, through an interpreter.

For a sport so endearingly averse to predictability, the WBC as a whole — and the title game in particular — wound its way back to the scenario everyone hoped it would. Before the game, Trout led the Americans out of the right field corner with an American flag. Ohtani led Japan out from left field. They are titans of their sport, the two players whose buy-in most helped this tournament take flight in its fifth iteration.

So much of the talk around this event, from pundits and players alike, has centered on its meaning. It is still new enough that it lacks lore. It is still establishing itself, so the commitment of players such as Trout, Ohtani and others improved its credibility dramatically.

That commitment was not just to playing — it was to caring. All of them, especially Ohtani, seemed to care a great deal. Before Tuesday’s game, he made a speech to his teammates in the clubhouse. A Los Angeles Times reporter translated it on Twitter.

“Let’s stop admiring them,” Ohtani said, according to the translation. “If you admire them, you can’t surpass them. We came here to surpass them, to reach the top.”

This was not an exhibition, at least not to those playing it. This was not soccer’s World Cup — not even close — and no one expects it to be. And this is not what regular season baseball, or even postseason baseball, feels like in the major leagues. This is something different.

“I think that’s the beautiful thing, right? That this can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people,” U.S. slugger Kyle Schwarber said before the game. “For me, obviously, getting to participate in this for the first time, this means a lot. It means a lot every time you are in the playoffs and you are in the World Series. ... It doesn’t change the level of how important this is to us. It just could mean something completely different to everyone, which I think is really cool.”

In return for their emotional investment, this tournament might just be raising the profile of some of the game’s biggest stars.

Trea Turner, for example, entered Tuesday’s final having already boosted his national stature in this tournament. U.S. Manager Mark DeRosa called Turner’s go-ahead grand slam against Venezuela in a quarterfinal one of the most memorable moments of his baseball life. Turner followed it with two more homers against Cuba in the semis, all while hitting ninth in the loaded U.S. order.

DeRosa joked after the semifinal that he was “the idiot” who batted Turner ninth, and he moved him up to sixth against Japan. Turner struck again in his first at-bat, blasting his fifth home run of the tournament, to tie for the most home runs in a WBC.

But this tournament is also raising the global stature of some of Japan’s biggest stars, many of whom will probably play in this stadium as major leaguers someday. One such star, newly crowned single-season home run champion Munetaka Murakami, was struggling to impress as Japan made its way through pool play and into the semifinals. But Monday night, the 23-year-old delivered the game-winning hit in the ninth inning. He hit the first pitch he saw Tuesday night 432 feet to tie the score. Japan added another run shortly thereafter to take the lead, something it did not do against Mexico until Murakami’s decisive swing in the ninth. Kazuma Okamoto, who said later that watching Ohtani face Trout was like something out of a comic book, added a solo homer in the fourth to make it 3-1.

“[Ohtani] is somebody we need to chase, to go after, but he’s doing something impossible,” Okamoto said after the game, through an interpreter.""He just keeps us motivated to catch up with him.""

Before the game, the Americans assumed they would be facing Yu Darvish. But Japanese Manager Hideki Kuriyama instead went with left-hander Shota Imanaga, who threw a no-hitter in Japan’s top league last year. He followed with four other pitchers, none of whom were named Yu Darvish, all of whom were unfamiliar to the American team, before Darvish handled the eighth and Ohtani the ninth. The Japanese pitching staff was loaded, from top to bottom, with ace-quality arms. And Kuriyama made sure the American hitters never got the chance to see any one of them twice.

The U.S. pitching staff, on the other hand, did not include many of the best Americans eligible to participate — in large part because many of them did not want to risk injury by ramping up to playoff intensity so early in the year.

“From a competitive perspective, I think the most important thing is we are going to need to continue to work with our clubs about pitching,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said about 90 minutes before the first pitch. “It’s great the guys that we’ve had, but I’d like to see pitching staffs that are of the same quality as our position players.”

What the Americans could have used, of course, was a high-quality position player who also happens to be a high-quality pitcher, unfathomable as such a thing may be.

“All you got to do is just be born to be able to throw a hundred and hit the ball 500 feet,” Lars Nootbar, the first American-born player to represent Japan in this tournament, said. “There’s really not that much going into it.”

As his teammates batted in the sixth inning, Japan’s designated hitter made his way to the bullpen. When his teammates staged a rally that turned the lineup over, Ohtani hurried back down the dugout steps. When he was left unneeded, he went back to the bullpen, only to return in time to hit in the seventh. Ohtani hit a 114-mph groundball to shortstop, and he beat it out. When he was erased on a double play shortly thereafter, he ambled back to the bullpen, with just enough time to ready himself for the ninth.

“I was just thinking about all the people around the world watching the game,"" U.S. Manager Mark DeRosa said. “It never usually plays out like that.”

As Ohtani arrived, another Japanese ace exited the bullpen to pitch the eighth. Darvish was the first pitcher Japan used all evening that the American hitters had seen before. And he became the first pitcher since the second inning to surrender a run when Schwarber hit an upper-deck homer to pull the Americans within a run. But Darvish held them there, then handed the proverbial torch to Ohtani, who lit the way to Japan’s third WBC title.

“He won Round One,” Trout said.

On Wednesday, all of these players will go their separate ways, back to Arizona and Florida and training camps in Japan. Both Trout and Ohtani said they would like to play again three years from now, when Ohtani is 31 and Trout is 34. Maybe they will get to play round two. Of course, everything would have to go exactly as planned for that to happen. In this sport, almost nothing ever seems to.

The reigning AL MVP is at the top of Fantasy baseball draft boards heading towards 2023 MLB Opening Day on March 30. Judge set a new American League record with 62 home runs and also led the AL in runs scored (133), RBI (131), walks (111), OBP (.425) and slugging (.686). However, while he's been relatively healthy the last two seasons, Judge did miss 142 games in the three seasons prior so there is some risk associated with taking Judge No. 1 overall.

The four-time All-Star has a 2023 Fantasy baseball ADP of 2.13 in CBS Sports Fantasy baseball leagues, but are there any other options that you should be considering if you own the No. 1 pick? A reliable set of 2023 Fantasy baseball rankings can help you react to the latest MLB injury news while also identifying potential 2023 Fantasy baseball sleepers. Before finalizing your 2023 Fantasy baseball draft prep, be sure to see the 2023 Fantasy baseball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.

Last season, SportsLine's Projection Model identified several top Fantasy baseball sleepers, breakouts and busts, including Cardinals second baseman Tommy Edman.

Edman had a 2022 Fantasy baseball ADP well outside the top 100 but the model predicted that he'd outperform that draft position. The result: Edman posted new career-highs in home runs (13), RBI (57) and stolen bases (32) while slashing a respectable .265/.324/.400 to finish as the third-best second baseman in Fantasy baseball. Anybody who followed its advice and picked up Edman late in their Fantasy baseball drafts received a huge power boost in their Fantasy baseball lineups.

The SportsLine model is engineered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. And that same group is sharing its 2023 Fantasy baseball rankings and cheat sheets over at SportsLine, helping you find Fantasy baseball sleepers, breakouts and busts long before your competition.

Any time more MLB news comes out about the updated 2023 MLB schedule, free agency signings or Fantasy baseball injuries, the team at SportsLine updates its projections. Go to SportsLine now to see these proven Fantasy baseball cheat sheets.

Top 2023 Fantasy baseball sleepers

One of the Fantasy baseball sleepers 2023 the model is high on: Twins first baseman Jose Miranda. A top-100 prospect entering last season, Miranda only spent a month in St. Paul playing triple-A ball before he earned a call-up to the majors and he never looked back, putting together an impressive rookie season. Miranda slashed .268/.325/.426 with 15 home runs and 66 RBI in 125 games.

Now he has a 2023 Fantasy baseball ADP of 191.31 in standard CBS Sports Fantasy baseball leagues but both his Fantasy backers and the Twins are hopeful that he's just scraping the surface of his potential. Miranda belted 30 home runs during his final full season in the minor leagues and also provides multi-position utility after playing 72 games at first and 30 at third last season. Those are big reasons why the model likes him over Vinnie Pasquantino and Ryan Mountcastle, who are both being drafted ahead of Miranda.

Another one of the Fantasy baseball sleepers 2023 the model is all over: Giants right fielder Mitch Haniger. The 32-year-old has flashed impressive power at times during his MLB career. In 2018, he slashed .285/.366/.493 with 26 home runs, 93 RBI and eight stolen bases on his way to making his only All-Star appearance. In 2021, he had 39 home runs, 100 RBI and an .804 OPS to register his second career top-20 finish in AL MVP voting.

Last season, he had 11 home runs and 34 RBI in a season that was mired by injury issues as he only played in 57 games and finished with a .736 OPS. But the Giants were willing to take a risk that Haniger could recapture the form that made him one of the most underrated players in baseball in 2018 and 2021, offering him a two-year, $28 million contract with a player option for 2025. And the model is predicting that Haniger outperforms Daulton Varsho and Teoscar Hernandez, who are both being drafted at least three rounds earlier on average.

How to find proven 2023 Fantasy baseball rankings

SportsLine's model is also high on a surprising starting pitcher who lands in the top 10 of its positional rankings. This player is barely going off the board in the top 125 picks, but is projected to outperform starters Aaron Nola, Shane McClanahan and Brandon Woodruff. This pick could be the difference in winning your league or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is here.

Marshall is the No. 198 prospect overall and the No. 9 recruit in the state of Ohio. He was a big target for in-state Ohio State, and the Wolverines were able to beat out the Buckeyes for one of the best running backs in the class. Marshall is a 5-foot-11, 195-pound prospect out of Moeller High School in Cincinnati. He is the third commitment for Michigan from the state of Ohio in the 2024 class, along with ESPN 300 offensive tackle Luke Hamilton and defensive tackle Ted Hammond. It was only a few years back that Jim Harbaugh was fielding questions about why he wasn't targeting more recruits from the state of Ohio and why the Buckeye State wasn't a priority for the team. Harbaugh signed four recruits out of Ohio in 2023 after signing nine prospects from the state in the seven recruiting classes from 2016 to 2022. Marshall's commitment is an important one for the Wolverines, given that he is a top prospect at a position of need; but getting a win over Ohio State on the recruiting trail is always a goal for the rival teams. Michigan has beaten Ohio State the past two seasons on the field. Now, Harbaugh has gone into Ohio and taken one of the top offensive prospects in the 2024 class in Marshall."

JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister, a senior ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, called Saturday for a freeze on the government’s controversial attempt to remake the country’s judicial system, saying the massive backlash it has sparked was becoming a threat to the country’s security. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Two other members of Netanyahu’s Likud party immediately joined in the call to pause the judicial push, and at least one other was said to be considering it, according to Israeli media. The defections could endanger the ability of Netanyahu’s coalition of ultra-Orthodox and right-wing nationalist parties, which hold only a four-seat majority in the parliament, to ram through the package of legislation.

The defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has been signaling for days that he was uncomfortable with the growing number of military members who have joined in the mass protest movement against the judicial overhaul. Hundreds of reservists have pledged to boycott their regular training missions, and the Israel Defense Forces confirmed that the number of absentees was growing.

Gallant had said on Thursday that he would make a public statement about the effect the turmoil was having on Israel’s military readiness. Instead, he was summoned to Netanyahu’s office and, following their meeting, canceled his planned appearance. It was the prime minister who took to the podium for a prime-time television address Thursday, in which he reassured the country that the changes were necessary and that he would push through key parts as soon as next week.

Exactly 48 hours later, with Netanyahu in London, Gallant went public with his concerns. Saying that he still supported the need to revamp the court system, he acknowledged that “unprecedented feelings of anger, pain and disappointment have risen” within the military over the proposed changes to Israel’s balance of power.

“This poses a clear, immediate, and tangible threat to the security of the state,” he said in the statement. “For the sake of Israel’s security, for the sake of our sons and daughters, the legislative process should be stopped.”

The coalition has proposed remaking the courts to give them more power to override Supreme Court decisions and to pick judges and justices. The long-sought changes are needed, they say, because the courts have become too powerful at the expense of elected officials and are hopelessly biased toward the country’s left-wing elite.

Opponents say the moves are an attempt by extreme right-wing politicians to eliminate one of the only checks on their power, a shift that would allow them to make radical changes to society and tilt the country toward authoritarianism.

The proposals, introduced without warning in January just days after the new government took power, sparked an outpouring of condemnation at home and abroad. Street protests numbering in the tens of the thousands erupted in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and other cities that have only grown since. Massive crowds were gathered Saturday night in several cities as Gallant spoke.

Far-right members of the coalition quickly condemned the minister’s statement. Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, an extremist settler leader whose party has called for the expulsion of “disloyal” Palestinians from Israel, called on Netanyahu to fire Gallant, according to media reports. The communications minister said his fellow Likud party member had “surrendered to pressure from the left.”

But other Likud leaders followed his lead: Yuli Edelstein, the former Knesset speaker who chairs the parliament’s committee on security and foreign affairs, and David Bitan, a Likud parliamentarian who has made his concerns public previously. At least one other was said to be wavering, according to Israeli media.

If all four voted against the bills, the coalition’s efforts could falter.

There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu’s office. The prime minister departed for London on Friday, where he was greeted by protesters and an admonition from British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on the need to uphold “democratic values.”

Opposition leaders, however, hailed Gallant’s move. Former prime minister Yair Lapid said in a statement it was a “brave and important step for the security of the State of Israel.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans on Saturday to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus.

Putin said the plan was in response to Britain’s decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium. Russia falsely claimed these rounds have nuclear components.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has long asked for the weapons, Putin said, speaking in an interview on Russian state television.

He said construction of storage facilities for the weapons in Belarus would be completed by July 1.

Russia used the territory of Belarus as a staging ground to send troops into Ukraine, and Moscow and Minsk have maintained close military ties."

Palmer Co. plant in West Reading, Pa., Friday, March 24, 2023. (AP)

An explosion at a chocolate factory in Pennsylvania on Friday killed two people and left five people missing, authorities said. One person was pulled from the rubble overnight.

Rescue crews using dogs and imaging equipment continued to search through the rubble Saturday — hours after the blast that erupted just before 5 p.m. Friday at the R.M. Palmer Co. plant in the borough of West Reading, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia.

West Reading officials said Saturday they could confirm only two fatalities. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency had earlier said there were five fatalities, citing county emergency management officials, but after an update from the county also indicated that two had died and five were missing.

Chief of Police Wayne Holben said the rescue of one person from the rubble “provides hope that others still may be found.” Rescue workers were continuing a thorough search using specialized equipment and techniques. Officials said dogs and imaging equipment were being used to look for signs of life during the careful removal of debris.

Holben said the blast destroyed one building and damaged a neighboring building. The cause remains under investigation, he said.

“It’s pretty leveled,” Mayor Samantha Kaag said of the explosion site. “The building in the front, with the church and the apartments, the explosion was so big that it moved that building four feet forward.”

A UGI Utilities spokesperson said crews were brought in after damage from the blast led to the release of gas that was helping to feed the fire.

“We did not receive any calls regarding a gas leak or gas order prior to the incident, but we are cooperating with the investigation and part of that will be to check all our facilities in the vicinity,” UGI spokesperson Joseph Swope said Saturday.

Eight people were taken to Reading Hospital Friday evening, Tower Health spokeswoman Jessica Bezler said. Two were admitted in fair condition and five were being treated and would be released, she said in an email. One patient was transferred to another facility, but Bezler provided no further details.

Kaag said people were asked to move back about a block in each direction but no evacuations were ordered. She had issued an emergency declaration only to allow more resources for first responders. Borough manager Dean Murray said some residents were displaced from the damaged apartment building.

Philip Wert, vice president of the West Reading council, said the building had been constructed in the late 1950s or early 1960s, and officials had to “access our archive to pull the blueprints last night, in order to get a better layout of the building and the mechanicals and the utilities, where things are.”

“The silver lining in all this is someone was found alive, someone was found alive that was in rubble, not knowing whether they were going to live or die, and fortunately we found that person and they’ve got a second chance, and hopefully fingers crossed we’re going to find more,” he said.

Officials said R.M. Palmer, which Murray described as “a staple of the borough,” was expected to make a statement shortly.

The company’s website says it has been making “chocolate novelties” since 1948 and now has 850 employees at its West Reading headquarters."
2023-03-26,2023-03-25 17:07:39,Rule of law on the ballot in Wisconsin Supreme Court justice runoff election,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/mar/25/rule-of-law-on-ballot-in-wisconsin-supreme-court-j/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,World,"OPINION:

The most interesting and perhaps most important single political campaign this year is occurring right now over the seventh and decisive seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

The two contestants are Republican Dan Kelly, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, and Democrat Janet Protasiewicz, a Circuit Court judge, the two top finishers in February’s jungle primary. The runoff between the two is on April 4. The winner’s political party will control a narrow 4-3 majority on the state’s highest court.

For the Republicans, the stakes are clear. A win by Judge Protasiewicz would almost certainly lead to an effort to redraw the state and congressional legislative districts (Republicans have comfortable margins in both the state Assembly and the state Senate).

A Wisconsin Supreme Court with Judge Protasiewicz would also almost certainly lead to greater tolerance of criminality, an important consideration in a state that in recent years has been rocked by riots in Kenosha and a racially motivated mass killing in Waukesha.

It has not been lost on voters that Judge Protasiewicz, in a ruling from the bench, gave no jail time to a woman who essentially starved her 15-year-old disabled child to death. Nor is it lost on voters that Judge Protasiewicz’s endorsements include a group that has sought to defund the police.

As for the Democrats, they have made this election entirely about abortion. When Roe v. Wade was overturned last June, Wisconsin law reverted to an 1849 law that outlaws abortion with no exception for saving the life of the mother. Both parties are dug in on this issue, and a legislative solution does not appear on the horizon.

Judge Protasiewicz has indicated that she will find a right to abortion in the state constitution if such a case arrived at the court. Justice Kelly has insisted, correctly, that a judge takes cases as they come and has refused to take a position.

It will come as no surprise that the national Democrats have become involved. Emily’s List — a national pro-abortion group — bragged in a recent mailer that it specifically broke with tradition to endorse Judge Protasiewicz because she is a “long-time community leader and proven pro-choice champion.”

It should also come as no surprise that folks on the right have gotten involved as well. The Judicial Fairness Initiative, which is a project of the Republican State Leadership Committee, recently ran ads in Wisconsin. The initiative’s president, Dee Duncan, said in a written statement: “The last thing the people of Wisconsin need is liberal outsiders telling them how to live their lives, at a time where the Badger State needs strong representation on the state supreme court to uphold the rule of law.”

One of the accelerants to this particular contest is that the election is for a 10-year term, so it has a certain fin-de-siecle overtone.

In the primary, Judge Protasiewicz received the most votes, almost 225,000 more than Justice Kelly. When the votes of all the primary candidates are combined, candidates on the left received about 75,000 more votes than those on the right. Simply aggregating votes in a jungle primary is not necessarily a sturdy methodology, as a candidate’s popularity is not always transferable.

That said, Justice Kelly has lost a Supreme Court runoff before. In 2020, he received 352,000 votes, which is about 150,000 fewer votes than he will need to win on April 4.

At the same time, Wisconsin has been trending, if haltingly, Republican over the last few election cycles. In 2008, President Barack Obama won the state by 400,000 votes. Eight years later, President Donald Trump won Wisconsin by about 23,000 votes.

More than $30 million has already been spent on the campaign, and the final number is likely to be much higher. The Democrats, as is the norm, are going to significantly outspend the Republicans. Despite that, the name recognition of the candidates in the February primary was not high, so there is still a chance, even at this late date, to brand the candidates.

In this contest, as in all races, turnout will be dispositive. The Democrats don’t even pretend that this is anything but a partisan election that will be driven by getting their voters to the polls. Wisconsin Republicans need to find a similar sense of urgency and direction if they hope to win.

2023-03-26,2023-03-25 16:51:33,Corrupting our children is one of the left’s favorite tactics,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/mar/25/corrupting-our-children-is-one-of-lefts-favorite-t/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS,World,"OPINION:

The enemies of civilization, the army of the “woke,” are sadists — period.

I used to think that they were merely blind to the suffering of others or viewed it as the necessary means to a higher end.

But it’s worse than that.

They think we deserve to suffer and are determined to see that we do — “we” being the middle class, especially those of us who are White, male and heterosexual.

Some middle school students at Utah’s Nebo School District were asked to eat insects as a class assignment.

The teacher explained that they are an excellent source of protein and we need to stop raising cows, which are killing the planet by causing climate change. One parent, who said her daughter was being indoctrinated in the “dark climate change religion,” blew the whistle.

If the teacher eats creepy-crawly things at home, I’ll believe she’s sincere. More likely, as a progressive, she’s disgusted by the dietary habits of the average American: Big Macs, beer, barbecue, and potatoes slathered with butter and sour cream. This revulsion finds its expression in a desire to see us chowing down on bugs.

Medieval monks and 17th-century Calvinists believed that suffering was good for the soul. The “woke” believe we deserve to suffer, regardless of its effect on our souls, for the sins of sexism, materialism, eco-genocide and white supremacy.

In California, the average price of gasoline is almost $5 a gallon, and Gov. Gavin Newsom loves it. He’d be thrilled if it reached $10 a gallon.

Those who shout “death to fossil fuels” are revolted by our alleged rape of the Earth and want to see us punished for it. They look forward to the day when we are shivering in our homes in the winter, with the thermostat set at 50, walking or bicycling to work because the cost of gas is beyond our reach, and smelly year-round because we can shower only once every two or three weeks.

They like seeing our city streets turned into homeless encampments, strewn with garbage and used needles, serving as breeding grounds for disease and vermin. They believe we’re responsible for homelessness and deserve to have our noses rubbed in it.

The crime explosion goes beyond hatred of police and sympathy for felons.

Liberal prosecutors and progressive mayors believe crime is bred by poverty and racism and, again, that it’s the fault of the White middle class. So, if our cities have come to resemble Kyiv at the height of the Russian bombing, it’s well-deserved punishment for our indifference to social pathologies.

With transgenderism, the Democratic Party has found a way to alienate family members from one another. The president recently called laws against transgender mutilation of minors “close to sinful.”

Corrupting our children is one of the left’s favorite tactics. Thus, the passion for explicit sex education courses that encourage adolescent experimentation and spectacles like “drag queen story hour.”

What better way to punish families for their heterosexual prejudice than to turn their sons into daughters and their daughters into sons? It’ll be such fun watching them squirm at Christmas, Thanksgiving and other family holidays. It also reduces the birthrate.

The two-pronged “woke” assault on the pillars of American society includes an attack on faith as well as family.

You can say anything in a public school today (including graphic descriptions of the most bizarre sex acts) except a prayer. It matters not how symbolic the act is. It took a Supreme Court decision to get a high school football coach reinstated after he was fired for praying silently on the field after a game.

The consolation of religion is also to be denied to us.

The left’s sadism is ingrained. From the Reign of Terror to the Cultural Revolution and the killing fields, it’s always been about inflicting maximum pain on humanity. Its followers are the ultimate misanthropes.

Former first lady Hillary Clinton called us “a basketful of deplorables.” President Barack Obama said small-town Americans “bitterly cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment.” President Biden says MAGA Republicans are enemies of democracy by refusing to accept the outcome of fixed elections.

What do you do with such violence-prone fanatics, insurrectionists and hate-mongers? Educate them? Impossible! No, you hurt them for being the miscreants that they are by getting their children to eat insects.

From Zimbabwe, where many must work at night because i t's the only time there is power, to Nigeria where collapses of the grid are frequent, the reliable supply of electricity remains elusive across Africa. (Sunday Alamba/AP)

From Zimbabwe, where many must work at night because it’s the only time there is power, to Nigeria where collapses of the grid are frequent, the reliable supply of electricity remains elusive across Africa.

The electricity shortages that plague many of Africa’s 54 countries are a serious drain on the continent’s economic growth, energy experts warn.

In recent years South Africa’s power generation has become so inadequate that the continent’s most developed economy must cope with rolling power blackouts of eight to 10 hours per day.

Africa’s sprawling cities have erratic supplies of electricity but large swaths of the continent’s rural areas have no power at all. In 2021, 43% of Africans — about 600 million people — lacked access to electricity with 590 million of them in sub‐Saharan Africa, according to the International Energy Agency.

Investments of nearly $20 billion are required annually to achieve universal electrification across sub-Saharan Africa, according to World Bank estimates. Of that figure nearly $10 billion is needed annually bring power and keep it on in West and Central Africa.

There are many reasons for Africa’s dire delivery of electricity including ageing infrastructure, lack of government oversight and a shortage of skills to maintain the national grids, according to Andrew Lawrence, an energy expert at the Witwatersrand University Business School in Johannesburg.

A historical problem is that many colonial regimes built electrical systems largely reserved for the minority white population and which excluded large parts of the Black population.

Today many African countries rely on state-owned power utilities.

Much attention has focused in the past two years on the Western-funded “Just Energy Transition,” in which France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union are offering funds to help poorer countries move from highly polluting coal-fired power generation to renewable, environmentally-friendly sources of power. Africa as a region should be among the major beneficiaries in order to expand electricity access on the continent and improve the struggling power grids, said Lawrence.

“The transition should target rural access and place at the forefront the electrification of the continent as a whole. This is something that is technically possible,” he said.

The Western powers vowed to make $8.5 billion available to help South Africa move away from its coal-fired power plants, which produce 80% of the country’s power.

As a result of its dependence upon coal, South Africa is among the top 20 highest emitters of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the world and accounts for nearly a third of all of Africa’s emissions, according to experts.

South Africa’s plan to move away from coal, however, is hampered by its pressing need to produce as much power as possible each day.

The East African nation of Uganda for years has also grappled with power cuts despite massive investment in electricity generation.

Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, has grappled with an inadequate power supply for many years, generating just 4,000 megawatts though the population of more than 210 million people needs 30,000 megawatts, say experts. The oil-rich but energy-poor West African nation has ramped up investments in the power sector but endemic corruption and mismanagement have resulted in little gains.

In Zimbabwe, electricity shortages that have plagued the country for years have worsened as the state authority that manages Kariba, the country’s biggest dam, has limited power generation due to low water levels.

Successive droughts have reduced Lake Kariba’s level so much that the Kariba South Hydro Power Station, which provides Zimbabwe with about 70% of its electricity, is currently producing just 300 megawatts, far less than its capacity of 1,050 megawatts.

Zimbabwe’s coal-fired power stations that also provide some electricity have become unreliable due to aging infrastructure marked by frequent breakdowns. The country’s solar potential is yet to be fully developed to meaningfully augment supply.

This means that Harare barber Omar Chienda never knows when he’ll have the power needed to run his electric clippers.

“What can we do? We just have to wait until electricity is back but most of the time it comes back at night,” said Chienda, a 39-year-old father of three. “That means I can’t work, my family goes hungry.”

In Nigeria’s capital city of Abuja, restaurant owner Favour Ben, 29, said she spends a large part of her monthly budget on electricity bills and on petrol for her generator, but adds that she gets only an average of 7 hours of power daily.

“It has been very difficult, especially after paying your electricity bill and they don’t give you light.” said Ben. “Most times, I prepare customers’ orders but if there is no light (power for a refrigerator), it turns bad the next day (and) I have lost money for that.”

Businesses in Nigeria suffer an annual loss of $29 billion as a result of unreliable electricity, the World Bank said, with providers of essential services often struggling to keep their operations afloat on generators.

As delegates gathered in Cape Town this month to discuss Africa’s energy challenges, there was a resounding sentiment that drawn-out power shortages on the continent had to be addressed urgently. There was some hope that the Western-funded “Just Energy Transition” would create some opportunities, but many remained skeptical.

Among the biggest critics of efforts to have countries like South Africa to transition quickly from the use of coal to cleaner energy is South Africa’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe.

He is among those advocating that Africa use all sources available to it to produce adequate power for the continent, including natural gas, solar, wind, hydropower and especially coal.

“Coal will be with us for many years to come. Those who see it as corruption or a road to whatever, they are going to be disappointed for many, many years,” said Mantashe. “Coal is going to outlive many of us.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., joined at left by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., speaks at a news conference about the treatment of people being held in the District of Columbia jail who are charged with crimes in the Jan. 6 insurrection, at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 7, 2021. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene swept into the District of Columbia jail to check on conditions for the Jan. 6 defendants, with Republican lawmakers handshaking and high-fiving the prisoners, who chanted “Let’s Go Brandon!” — a coded vulgarity against President Joe Biden — as the group left.

A day earlier Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with the mother of slain rioter Ashli Babbitt, a Navy veteran who was shot and killed by police as she tried to climb through a broken window during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.

And the House Republican leader recently gave Fox News’ Tucker Carlson exclusive access to a trove of Jan. 6 surveillance tapes despite the conservative commentator’s airing of conspiracy theories about the Capitol attack.

Taken together, the House Republicans can be seen as working steadily but intently to distort the facts of the deadly riot, which played out for the world to see when Donald Trump’s supporters laid siege to the Capitol, and in the process downplay the risk of domestic extremism in the U.S.

In actions and legislation, the Republicans are seeking to portray perpetrators of the Capitol riot as victims of zealous federal prosecutors, despite many being convicted of serious crimes. As Trump calls for the Jan. 6 defendants to be pardoned, some House Republicans are attempting to rebrand those who stormed the Capitol as “political prisoners.”

The result is alarming to those who recognize a dangerously Orwellian attempt to whitewash recent history.

“There’s no question Marjorie Taylor Greene and other Republicans are attempting to rewrite history,” said Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “They’re making light of what was a serious attack on our democracy.”

The tour Greene led at the local jail Friday comes as nearly 1,000 people have been charged by the Justice Department in the attack on the Capitol — leaders of the extremist Oath Keepers convicted of seditious conspiracy. The 20 or so defendants being held at the jail, many in pretrial detention on serious federal charges, are among those who battled police at the Capitol, officials said, in what at times was a gruesome bloody scene of violence and mayhem.

Greene told The Associated Press the idea she’s trying to rewrite history is the “stupidest thing” she’s ever heard of, especially since the assault on the Capitol has been captured in the 41,000 hours of video that McCarthy made available to Fox News.

“We can’t rewrite it — it’s all on video,” Greene told the AP.

“You can’t change the history, but what we can do is expose the truth. That’s what we need to do,” Greene said.

The country has been here before — in the aftermath of the Civil War, when the Lost Cause movement sought to reframe the battle over ending slavery in the U.S. as one of states’ rights, and again in the years following the Civil Rights movement as critics of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. questioned his transformative legacy.

In the House under Republican control this year, the new leadership openly questions what happened on Jan. 6 as well as how the federal government is investigating and prosecuting extremists. Outside groups are raising money and rallying to the aid of Jan. 6 defendants.

This past week, a Republican-led Judiciary subcommittee probed the federal government’s treatment of parents protesting school board policies — sometimes violently — as unfair. Next week, the new Republican committee on the “weaponization” of the federal government will delve into First Amendment free speech rights on social media.

McCarthy warned that the federal government is labeling parents as “domestic terrorists” for showing up at school board meetings, even though such prosecutions are extremely rare.

His was a reference to a 2021 Justice Department memo from Attorney General Merrick Garland responding to the National School Board Association’s concerns about violent protesters at school board meetings. Garland had directed federal law enforcement to address what he called a “disturbing spike” in harassment of school officials.

Probing the matter, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee released a report showing that in one federal investigation, the FBI interviewed a mom for allegedly telling a local school board “we are coming for you.” In another, the FBI investigated a dad who opposed COVID mask mandates after a tipster to a federal hotline said he “fit the profile of an insurrectionist” because he “rails against the government” and “has a lot of guns and threatens to use them.”

“Parents should have a right to go to school board meetings and not be called terrorists,” McCarthy said.

While Greene has said the Capitol attack was wrong, at the jail visit Friday she said she believes there’s a “two-tiered” justice system and that the Jan. 6 defendants are being “treated as political prisoners” for their beliefs.

Democrats on the tour said that is categorically false. While the local jail came has long been the subject of complaints — the U.S. Marshals made plans to relocate 400 detainees after a surprise 2021 inspection found parts of the facility “do not meet the minimum standards” — the Jan. 6 defendants have been housed in a newer wing that was not cited as problematic in the Marshals’ statement.

The two Democrats who joined the tour as members of the House Oversight Committee said they both had visited detention facilities before. “It’s probably as good as a jail can be,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a former public defender.

Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California noted the way the Republicans led by Greene treated the Jan. 6 defendants as celebrities — shaking their hands and slapping backs when the lawmakers arrived in the jail facility.

As they left, the defendants chanted the “Let’s Go Brandon!” phrase against Biden, he said in a tweet.

“What is most important to remember is that while Marjorie Taylor Greene and others want to treat these folks as pseudo celebrities, some of these folks are insurrectionists,” Garcia told reporters. “And we can’t forget that.”"

Staring down a possible indictment, a defiant Donald Trump is hoping to put on a show of force Saturday as he holds the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign in a city made famous by deadly resistance against law enforcement.

The former president will gather with supporters at an airport in Waco, which will mark the 30th anniversary of the Waco massacre next month. In 1993, an attempted raid by law enforcement of a compound belonging to the Branch Davidians, a religious cult, resulted in a shootout that led to a 51-day siege, ending in a blaze that left dozens dead.

The rally comes as Trump has berated prosecutors, encouraged protests and raised the prospect of possible violence should he become the first former president in U.S. history to face criminal charges. Some of his recent rhetoric has echoed language he used before the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters seeking to stop the transfer of power.

“What kind of person can charge another person, in this case a former President of the United States ... and leading candidate (by far!) for the Republican Party nomination, with a Crime, when it is known by all that NO Crime has been committed, & also known that potential death & destruction in such a false charge could be catastrophic for our Country?” Trump wrote on his social media site early Friday.

Trump’s campaign insisted the location and timing of the event had nothing to do with the Waco siege or anniversary. Instead, a spokesperson said the site was chosen because it was conveniently situated near four of the state’s biggest metropolitan areas — Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio — and has the infrastructure to handle a sizable crowd.

“This is the ideal location to have as many supporters from across the state and in neighboring states attend this historic rally,” said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung.

The city is part of McLennan County, which Trump won in 2020 by more than 23 points. The airport where the rally is being held is 17 miles from the Branch Davidian compound.

The rally had already been in the works before it became clear that a grand jury in New York was drawing closer to a possible indictment as it investigates hush money payments made to women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump during the height of his 2016 campaign. Trump has denied the women’s claims.

But the timing will give Trump an opportunity to demonstrate his continued popularity with the GOP base and to portray himself as the victim of a politically motivated “witch hunt” as he campaigns for a second term in the White House.

The grand jury investigating the hush money payment is expected to meet again Monday in New York.

Trump has spent weeks now railing against the investigation. In a move that seemed designed to preempt a formal announcement and to galvanize his loyal base, he claimed last Saturday that he would be arrested the following Tuesday. While that did not happen, Trump has used the days since to try to shape public perception, claiming, for instance, that the Manhattan district attorney’s office had plunged into “Total disarray,” though there was no evidence to suggest prosecutors were backing away from the case.

His efforts echoed a strategy the former president has used before, including during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

Trump has also launched a series of increasingly personal attacks against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, calling him “a danger to our Country” who “should be removed immediately,” and using increasingly racist and dehumanizing rhetoric.

On Thursday, he sought to tie Bragg, Manhattan’s first Black district attorney, to George Soros, a liberal billionaire donor who doesn’t know Bragg and hasn’t donated directly to him. “A SOROS BACKED ANIMAL,” Trump wrote of Bragg, adding, “THIS IS NO LEGAL SYSTEM, THIS IS THE GESTAPO.” He also shared an article that juxtaposed a picture of Bragg with a photo of Trump swinging a baseball bat in Bragg’s direction.

The former president has also repeatedly involved violence. Last Saturday, he called on his supporters to “PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!” And on Thursday, he bemoaned, “OUR COUNTRY IS BEING DESTROYED, AS THEY TELL US TO BE PEACEFUL!”

On Friday, a powdery substance was found with a threatening letter in a mailroom at Bragg’s offices, authorities said. Officials later determined the substance wasn’t dangerous.

Bragg’s office sent an internal email to staff last Saturday saying, “We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York.” After the powder was discovered, Bragg sent another email to staffers telling them their safety was the top priority.

“We will continue to apply the law evenly and fairly, which is what each of you does every single day,” he wrote Friday.

Even before the threatening letter was sent to Bragg’s office, Democrats warned that Trump’s remarks had the potential to incite violence.

“The twice-impeached former president’s rhetoric is reckless, reprehensible and irresponsible. It’s dangerous, and if he keeps it up he’s going to get someone killed,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier Friday.

The Manhattan case focuses on a $130,000 payment that Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, made to porn actor Stormy Daniels as Trump was in the throes of the 2016 campaign. Trump later reimbursed Cohen and his company logged the reimbursements as a legal expense. Cohen has already served time in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, among other crimes.

Trump is also facing an investigation in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election as well as federal probes into his handling of classified documents and possible obstruction, as well as his efforts on Jan. 6.

2023-03-26,2023-03-25 14:33:30,Texas police: Migrants found ‘suffocating’ in train; 2 dead,https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-aud-nw-migrants-train-car-20230325-f2ebvfseqbdiff6g3plqmopzlq-story.html#ed=rss_www.chicagotribune.com/arcio/rss/category/nation-world/,World,"Officials investigate the scene where migrants were found trapped in a train car, Friday, March 24, 2023 in Ulvalde, Texas. Union Pacific railroad said in a statement that the people were found in two cars on the train traveling east from Eagle Pass bound for San Antonio. (William Luther/AP)

Two migrants were found dead and at least 10 were hospitalized Friday after police in South Texas received a call that they were “suffocating” in a freight train traveling near the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Uvalde Police Department said Border Patrol was informed of the phone call and able to stop the train. About 15 migrants were found inside, according to a statement from the department.

Union Pacific railroad said in a statement that the people were found in two cars on the train traveling east from Eagle Pass bound for San Antonio: 12 in a shipping container and three in a hopper car. The two people who died were in the shipping container, the statement said.

At least four people were air-lifted to San Antonio, authorities said, while others were taken to local hospitals.

The condition of all of those hospitalized was not immediately known. University Health in San Antonio tweeted that it had received two male patients, one in critical condition and one in serious condition.

Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez told the San Antonio-Express News that dispatchers received a 911 call about 3:50 p.m. from an unknown person seeking help. The train was stopped near the town of Knippa, which is less than 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the southern border.

“We’re still trying to determine if it was from someone inside the car,” Rodriguez said. “We’re assuming it was from inside one of the cars.”

Uvalde police said that Union Pacific railroad would lead the investigation.

In a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas suggested the deaths and injuries were linked to human trafficking and pledged to hold those responsible accountable.

“We are heartbroken to learn of yet another tragic incident of migrants taking the dangerous journey,” Mayorkas said on Twitter. “Smugglers are callous and only care about making a profit.”

A cause of death Friday was not immediately clear. Highs in the area neared 90 degrees (32.2 Celsius), and shipping containers often get much hotter than the surrounding temperature.

Last summer, more than 50 migrants died after dozens of people were found in the back of a sweltering tractor-trailer that had been abandoned on the outskirts of San Antonio. The tragedy was the nation’s deadliest smuggling episode on America’s southern border, which led to officials vowing to step up policing efforts.

Migrants routinely travel through Uvalde, leading to high-speed vehicle pursuits that put schools in the area on lockdown. After the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde last May, when a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers, Texas lawmakers concluded in a report that the frequency of the lockdowns may have led to a “diminished sense of vigilance” about security.

Union Pacific said it was “deeply saddened by this incident and the tragedies occurring at the border. We take the safety of all individuals seriously and work tirelessly with law enforcement partners to detect illegal items and people riding inside or on our rail cars.”

On the other side of Texas, a 17-year-old was charged Friday with kidnapping two migrants whose rescue this week from a Houston hotel by FBI agents ended in gunfire that killed another suspect.

The migrants were stopped on a highway northwest of Houston on Saturday and were forced into another vehicle by the kidnappers, according to a prosecutor. Officials have said little about what happened between then and Thursday morning, when the FBI says its agents rescued two migrants following the shooting in north Houston."
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 15:15:00,Who Are Best American Horror Story Characters,https://markmeets.com/tv/who-are-best-american-horror-story-characters/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=who-are-best-american-horror-story-characters,Sports,"American Horror Story has been full of horrifying characters tangled up in terrifying tales of haunted houses for For 11 seasons with creepy covens, fearful freak shows and so many more. While typically played by a recognizable ensemble each season, each and every character plays an intricate piece of the petrifying puzzle.

Which iconic American Horror Story character comes out on top?

Ryan Murphy’s hit anthology horror series has become on the most beloved and critically-acclaimed shows of the 21st century, particularly among the LGBTQ community, inspiring fervent debate among fans about their favourite season or character.

As season nine, 1984, races along to its conclusion – which we’re sure will be full of twists and turns – we’ve ranked the 13 best characters to emerge from the show so far. And who knows, when 1984 finishes, we might have a new addition…

From Evan Peters’ most mad and memorable to a clown scarier than Pennywise to some Freak Show performers so loved they appeared in more than one season, some characters on AHS will never be forgotten.

Lana Winters (‘Asylum,’ ‘Roanoke,’ ‘Cult’)

It’s impossible not to love every AHS character portrayed by Sarah Paulson, but the fan favorite since American Horror Story: Asylum has been journalist and LGBTQ icon Lana Winters.

Lana’s story of reporting on Briarcliff manor’s serial killer patient takes a twisted turn when she’s committed as a patient to treat her homosexuality, and after coming out on top, comes out of retirement in Roanoke to interview that season’s victim Lee Harris.

Tate Langdon (‘Murder House,’ ‘Apocalypse’)

Tate Langdon will always be the GOAT of American Horror Story for being Evan Peters’ first creepy character of the series in the season of the horror show that started it all, Murder House. This character, despite being a mass murderer, is a beloved ghost trapped in the Murder House and is most remembered for his not-so-meet cute with Violet and his notable painted face that resembled a skeleton.

Pepper (‘Asylum,’ ‘Freak Show’)

Pepper became a fan favorite in American Horror Story: Asylum when she was introduced as a patient at Briarcliff Manor after being framed for the murder of an infant, but that wasn’t where Pepper’s story began.

When the show flashed back in American Horror Story: Freak Showthe following season, Pepper’s earlier life was revealed to be one of a performer in a traveling carnival after being taken under Elsa Mars’ wing and meeting her love, Salty.

Moira O’Hara (‘Murder House,’ ‘Asylum’)

Plenty of memorable characters came out of American Horror Story during its first season titled Murder House, and a favorite was Moira O’Hara, the housekeeper with an unexpectedly tragic past.

Moira O’Hara was an innocent, young housekeeper who had an affair with the homeowner, landing her with a gunshot through the eye at the hands of his wife and then as a ghost trapped in the Murder House.

Elsa Mars (‘Freak Show’)

Elsa Mars remains both a beautiful and intriguing character from American Horror Story: Freak Show, who leads her group of “monsters” as their carnival travels to perform their freak show.

Elsa’s most memorable moment of the season teeters between her gorgeous rendition of “Life on Mars” by David Bowie during her show, and the moment it’s revealed that Elsa has two amputated legs, making her a “freak” like everyone else.

Kai Anderson (‘Cult’)

Kai Anderson remains one of the scariest characters of AHS, simply for how close-to-home American Horror Story: Cult felt when it aired in 2017. Kai leads the season as a cult leader involved with bad politics who is openly a Trump supporter.

Kai terrifies in a season focused on the political chaos caused by the 2016 presidential election, with his simultaneously most memorable and most cringy moment being when he crushed Cheetos and spread the orange dust all over his face in support of his presidential pick.

Madison Montgomery (‘Coven,’ ‘Apocalypse’)

Emma Roberts has played four different characters over five seasons of American Horror Story, but her best remembered was her AHS debut as Madison Montgomery in the season titled Coven.

Madison Montgomery is a telekinetic teen witch with a lot of blood on her hands, but also some romance in her heart when she helps reconcile Murder House OTP Tate and Violet in American Horror Story: Apocalypse after visiting the infamous Murder House.

Twisty (‘Freak Show,’ ‘Cult’)

For anyone who thinks Pennywise or Art is the scariest clowns in existence, you’ve clearly never seen Twisty from American Horror Story: Freak Show, with his dark eyes, blood-stained forehead and creepy, grinning mask that covers his lower face.

Like many other killer clowns, Twisty is a kidnapper and murderer whose crimes became so famous, they spawned a comic book series and action figures that later appeared in American Horror Story: Cult.

The Countess (‘Hotel’)

American Horror Story: Hotel was a memorable fifth season thanks to Lady GaGa’s debut as The Countess, an old but glamorous woman who owns the hotel and feasts on guests’ blood to keep herself alive.

When this vampiress wasn’t devouring her victims, she was infecting people with her blood virus in order to keep them as lovers, offering them eternal life in exchange for them committing to her and only her.

Sister Jude Martin (‘Asylum’)

There’s arguably not an unfavorable character played by Jessica Lange, but of all the actress’ AHS characters, it’s Sister Jude Martin from American Horror Story: Asylum that takes the number one spot.

Who starts out as the head of power at Briarcliff Manor slowly transforms into the story of an abusive nun who gets the tables turned on her for every unjust punishment she performed on patients at the asylum."
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 14:50:17,Ottawa planning to use Tyler Kleven in the NHL this season,https://www.inforum.com/sports/und-hockey/ottawa-planning-to-use-tyler-kleven-in-the-nhl-this-season,Sports,"GRAND FORKS — Tyler Kleven won't have to wait long for his first NHL game.

Ottawa Senators head coach D.J. Smith said Friday he plans to use the former UND defenseman in the NHL this season.

""I don't know if there's an exact science as to when is ready, but we're going to get him in there,"" Smith told the Ottawa media. ""If we get another injury, he's in automatically. But at this point, our plan is that we are going to get him into games. You can't guarantee anything, but as a coaching staff, we want to get him in.""

Smith said Kleven would not play Saturday at New Jersey, though.

""He doesn't know any of the systems,"" Smith said. ""He hasn't played an NHL game. So, we're going to put him in the right scenario. He won't play (Saturday). Then, we'll make that decision when we get home with a practice under his belt. It's probably been a bit of a whirlwind for him, just getting in, (undergoing) medicals, and all the things that have to go with it. I think just watching a game, seeing everything about it, the hotel, new teammates, all that stuff, we'll let him take that in, and then we'll make that call from there.""

Kleven, of Fargo, signed a three-year deal with Ottawa on Thursday after spending three years at UND.

His contract begins this season.

Kleven flew to Montreal and drove to Ottawa on Thursday night.

On Friday, Kleven skated with the Senators for the first time.

""Impressive,"" Smith said of his first impressions. ""Impressive skating, size, shot. Now, obviously, we know the NHL is a lot with details and the things that come with it, but the raw package itself is impressive — just the size and the skating to go with it. Like we all know, there are growing pains that come along with it, but he looks all the physical attributes of a hockey player, for sure.""

Kleven admitted he was a little starstruck meeting some of the Senators players like Claude Giroux.

""He came up to me and shook my hand,"" Kleven said, ""and I'm like holy smokes, I'm here.""

Kleven was quite familiar with other Senators players — notably former UND teammates Jake Sanderson and Shane Pinto.

""I was roommates with Jake back at North Dakota, so I'm pretty close with him,"" Kleven said. ""It makes the transition process a lot easier knowing somebody.""

Kleven will wear No. 43 with the Senators. He wore that number while playing for USA Hockey's National Team Development Program.

""It's a whole new world I'm being brought into here with professional sports,"" Kleven said. ""I'm just going to take it all in, try to learn from it, try to do whatever I can to help the team.""

Kleven said he felt the time was right to make the jump to pro hockey, but it wasn't easy to leave UND.

""The (UND) coaching staff is unbelievable,"" Kleven said. ""All my teammates there, I'm very thankful for. It's a tough decision when the time comes. After three years, I felt my time there was coming to an end. We had a really good run there. We won a couple of season championships. I'm really happy with my time, but it was time to take the next step.

""I felt my game took a step this year. Brad (Berry) gave me a lot of confidence with the positions he put me in."""
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 13:12:00,What to Know Before Becoming an Entrepreneur,https://markmeets.com/business/what-to-know-before-becoming-an-entrepreneur/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-to-know-before-becoming-an-entrepreneur,Sports,"Becoming an entrepreneur can be an exciting and rewarding journey, but it’s important to understand the challenges that come with starting your own business. Here are some things to consider before taking the leap:

Risk and uncertainty: Starting a business involves a lot of risk and uncertainty. There’s no guarantee that your idea will succeed or that you’ll make a profit. You may have to invest a significant amount of time and money before seeing any returns.

Time commitment: Starting a business can be time-consuming, especially in the beginning stages. You may have to work long hours and weekends to get your business off the ground. This can be challenging if you have other commitments, such as a full-time job or a family.

Financial management: As an entrepreneur, you’ll be responsible for managing your finances. This includes budgeting, forecasting, and keeping track of your expenses. You may also need to secure funding or loans to get your business up and running.

As an entrepreneur, traditional banking can be a confusing and restrictive process when it comes to managing your business finances. Fortunately, modern banking solutions provide more freedom and flexibility to help you run your business successfully. Many of these alternative platforms offer features such as automated accounting systems, real-time analytics, user-friendly dashboard designs that make it easy to see where your money is going and coming from, and secure payment processing.

All of these features put you in control and can save you time and money by streamlining traditional banking tasks like transferring funds, reconciling accounts, granting access to different departments within your business, or tracking expenses. With modern banking solutions, running a successful business as an entrepreneur isn’t just possible – it’s achievable.

Adaptability: The business world is constantly changing, and as an entrepreneur, you’ll need to be adaptable to stay ahead of the curve. This may mean pivoting your business model, changing your target market, or embracing new technologies.

Speaking of new technologies, one of the most important things for entrepreneurs to understand is the role of technology in today’s business landscape. Technology has changed the way we do business in countless ways, from communication and marketing to data analysis and customer service.

One of the biggest ways that technology has impacted entrepreneurship is through the rise of e-commerce. With platforms like Shopify and Amazon, it’s easier than ever for entrepreneurs to start an online store and reach customers all over the world. This has opened up new opportunities for small businesses and has leveled the playing field in many industries.

Another way that technology has impacted entrepreneurship is through the rise of digital marketing. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become essential tools for businesses of all sizes to reach their target audience and build brand awareness. This has made it easier for small businesses to compete with larger companies that have bigger marketing budgets.

Technology has also revolutionized the way that businesses collect and analyze data. With tools like Google Analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) software, entrepreneurs can get valuable insights into their customers’ behavior and preferences. This can help them make better decisions about product development, marketing, and customer service.

However, it’s important for entrepreneurs to remember that technology is constantly evolving, and what works today may not work tomorrow. It’s important to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and tools in your industry and be willing to adapt your business strategies as needed.

In conclusion, becoming an entrepreneur can be a challenging but rewarding journey. It’s important to understand the risks and uncertainties involved, as well as the time commitment and financial management required. Additionally, entrepreneurs should be aware of the role that technology plays in today’s business landscape and be willing to adapt to new trends and tools as they emerge. By doing so, they can position themselves for success and achieve their goals as business owners."
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 10:00:00,What Are The Main Benefits of a Multi-Currency Account,https://markmeets.com/finance/what-are-the-main-benefits-of-a-multi-currency-account/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-are-the-main-benefits-of-a-multi-currency-account,Sports,"Increasingly, businesses operate across borders and need business account solutions that let them send and receive money wherever their clients and business partners are based.

Traditional single currency bank accounts mean paying currency conversion fees on every transaction. But with the rise of multi-currency accounts, this is no longer the case.

Here we set out five benefits of using a multi-currency account.

What is a multi-currency account?

A multi-currency account allows a business to receive, send and hold money in more than one currency. This distinguishes it from a single-currency account, which always requires that money be converted to and from the “home currency” of the account.

Banks, neobanks or fintech companies can issue multi-currency accounts.

Note that a multi-currency account does not mean an every-currency account. The specific currencies that can be used with a multi-currency account are determined by the bank or fintech that provides the account.

Which business can benefit from a multi-currency account?

A multi-currency account can save time, money, and effort for any business that deals in several currencies.

A multi-currency account is beneficial for companies that:

Trade internationally via exporting and/or importing.

Run an ecommerce store that sells its goods in multiple currencies.

Hire staff abroad or work with freelancers overseas.

It’s also beneficial for solopreneurs, independent contractors and freelancers that work with international clients regularly.

What are the benefits of using a multi-currency account?

Benefit #1: Reduce currency exchange fees

Perhaps the most important reason to have a multi-currency account is to reduce foreign exchange fees. In a single currency account, all payments received in other currencies or payments made in another currency will result in a currency conversion fee. In the case of banks, this fee can be substantial. For businesses working across more than one currency, these fees add up quickly and constitute a significant expense.

With a multi-currency account, money can be held in the ‘non-home’ currency: There is no need to convert, though, of course, the business can decide to do so — at a time of their choosing.

While there is often a small fee for converting from one currency to another within the multi-currency account, as the conversion needs to be made less regularly, conversion fees are reduced substantially.

Benefit #2: Streamlined reconciliation and accounting

One of the complications of operating a business in multiple currencies is managing the discrepancy between invoices in one currency and payments in another. Not to mention accounting for the extra currency conversion transaction on every payment or receipt.

With a multi-currency account, payments can be received in the invoiced foreign currency, meaning invoices and payments match, and there are fewer total transactions to account for. While amounts in foreign currencies may have to be rendered in the “home currency” for financial reporting purposes, this will only be required periodically (rather than constantly), and it usually doesn’t need the currency to actually be converted.

Benefit #3: Manage currency fluctuations to your benefit

The last few years have seen some major currencies take substantial unexpected dips. As multi-currency accounts make it easy to do currency conversions at any time, a business can choose to convert currencies when the exchange rate is in their favor and hold off on doing so when the exchange rate is unfavorable.

By contrast, the business is forced to accept the consequences of any unfavorable fluctuation with a single currency account.

Benefit #4: Combine with FX forward contracts to lock in prices

When a business has a contract with clients in a currency different from its home currency, it can be difficult to predict the final amount that will be paid. With a single currency account, the business is subject to whichever foreign exchange rate the bank or fintech applies at the time of payment.

By combining a multi-currency account with an FX forward contract, however, a company can receive and hold the payments in a client’s chosen currency, then lock in a future exchange rate to convert to the home currency at a set later date.

Benefit #5: Simplicity of one account and interface

Without a multi-currency account, it may be necessary to hold multiple separate accounts in different currencies (foreign currency accounts). Transferring between those accounts creates unnecessary complexity for smaller businesses and makes it more difficult for entrepreneurs to have a “quick overview” of their financial status.

With modern multi-currency accounts, an intuitive interface makes it clear at a quick glance exactly how much money the business holds in each denomination.

Growing a business internationally requires a reliable mechanism for making and receiving payments in more than one currency. Multi-currency accounts allow businesses to save on foreign exchange fees and transfer money internationally more quickly and effectively."
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 08:17:26,Lakers finally reach .500 after 74 games,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/35940765/lakers-reach-500-74-games-not-finished?device=featurephone,Sports,"LOS ANGELES -- The Lakers' 116-111 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday brought their record to .500 for the first time all season, needing 74 games to get even after a 2-10 start. ""Now it's time, instead of constantly facing a deficit, we get to try to create a surplus, create a cushion between the wins and losses,"" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. ""So the guys are excited about that."" At 37-37, the Lakers reached .500 for the first time as a franchise in more than 400 days, dating back to Jan. 25, 2022, when the team was 24-24. The last NBA team to reach .500 for the first time this late in a season was the 2003-04 Miami Heat, which took 78 games to get there, according to ESPN Stats & Information. The 1988-89 Washington Bullets also took 74 games and the 1983-84 Phoenix Suns didn't get to .500 until Game No. 82. ""Big accomplishment but we're still not finished,"" said Dennis Schroder, who started in place of D'Angelo Russell (sore right hip) and finished with 21 points and six assists. Lakers guard Lonnie Walker IV scored 20 points off the bench after only playing 12 minutes in L.A.'s past seven games, including five DNPs. ""He's the guy who won us the game, it's that simple,"" Schroder said of Walker. ""Everybody thanked him for that tonight. This is his win."" The win was L.A.'s third in a row and gave the Lakers the same record as the Western Conference's No. 7-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves. L.A. is No. 8, however, because the Wolves own the tiebreaker by leading the season series 2-0 with only one more matchup remaining. ""We got to .500, now it's time to get on the other side and can have more wins than losses,"" said Anthony Davis, who led L.A. with 37 points and 15 rebounds. ""So it starts Sunday. We got an opportunity to be a game above .500 against a good Bulls team."" Hosting Chicago will be the last of L.A.'s current five-game homestand before going on the road for a four-game trip through Chicago, Minnesota, Houston and Utah. ""We just have to approach these upcoming games, these last eight, like we've been doing since the deadline: Each game is its own entity,"" Ham said. ""We can't worry about going 6-2 or 7-1 or 5-3. We just have to approach each game and dive and pour all of ourselves into each particular game. So we'll continue to carry on as such."""
2023-03-25,2023-03-25 08:15:00,Top 10 cheapest games you can buy on Nintendo Switch,https://markmeets.com/gaming/top-10-cheapest-games-you-can-buy-on-nintendo-switch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-10-cheapest-games-you-can-buy-on-nintendo-switch,Sports,"‘Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’, ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’, ‘Super Smash Bros’, and ‘The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ remain the best selling games in the switch, but what are the best value games if you want to test something new?

While we all love a good bargain, cheap doesn’t always mean cheerful. Sometimes it leads to regret, and wishing you’d bought a couple of Freddo’s with your pennies instead. But there’s also always the chance you’ll stumble onto some real treasure. That’s why we decided to raid the bargain bin end of the Nintendo Switch eShop for the 10 cheapest games we could find to see if taking the risk on low-cost titles is ever worth.

We’ve ranked them from worst to best, and ruled out the best free-to-play games (that’s another minefield altogether) and anything on sale as that felt like cheating – the sort of games that won’t stay cheap forever! We also focused on picking just one title if it was part of a series, and aimed to try out as many different genres as possible. There’s a huge number of games that cost 89p, but are any of them worth it? The games here are the absolute cheapest ones you can buy on your Switch right now.

10. Jigsaw Masterpieces – Be The Cube – 89p

This is the only game on this list where I feel like I’ve been conned. It’s a very simple jigsaw game; move pieces one by one onto a canvas to make up the picture. That part of it is surprisingly satisfying, as pieces snap together to form a whole photo. However there are only a few images available in this version of the game – to actually get a decent amount of puzzles to play with, you have to pay more than you did for the base game. It feels really stingy and mean-spirited for what amounts to a set of stock photos of animals.

9. Super Meatball – Wowwow technology – 75p

This party game is essentially what would happen if you tried playing Rocket League on the dinner table. You pick a cute car and then try to bump a meatball into a giant shark mouth at either end of a table. This would be a cute take on the genre if it worked and maybe had more than one dining set up to play on. The single-player is just a ‘practice’ mode that has you drive around on your tod, and multiplayer is no fun when the meatball gets stuck to your kart and no one can score a goal. I wish I had spent the money on a Dairy Milk instead – I’d be a lot more satisfied.

8. Words With Freds – Mokuzai Studio – 89p

No, it’s not a typo, though sadly there are also no Freds to be found in this word game – it’s just a complete rip off of Wordle. Guess a five-letter word and it’ll tell you if you’ve hit a correct letter, then keep guessing within six turns to figure it out. The one thing this has going for it is that you’re not limited to one puzzle a day, but there are no extra twists or anything of interest. If you want to pay for an endless Wordle clone then this is for you, but why would you when there are so many better, free versions to find online?

7. Funny Truck – RandomSpin Games – 89p

Adding a laughter track and fart noises does nothing to hide the lack of hilarity in this tiny vehicle playground. You steer a red truck around a small arena filled with ramps and trampolines as people spill out the back and ragdoll all over the floor. This is very much a game for five-year olds, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. A simple space with funny noises and bouncy movement with no end goal is perfect for a young kid, but if your preschool years are behind you this is a complete waste of your money. Save up for a Gregg’s sausage roll instead.

6. Escape Game & Card Search Game R01M – AlignmentSharp – 80p

Have you ever been stuck outside of an AirBnB trying to figure out how to get the keys from the lockbox? This is like that but in reverse; you’re trapped inside a small flat (with questionable taste in decor) trying to get out. There are a lot of little puzzles to solve that you can find the solutions to by poking around bookcases and peering out the windows. Unfortunately, quite a lot of them are really obtuse and it doesn’t feel like you’re actually puzzling anything out, and while the price tag feels about right for the experience, it’s not fun. Save up for something like The Room instead.

5. Toree 3D – Diplodocus Games – 89p

This 90s-inspired platformer is a throwback to the days when all animal protagonists wore sunglasses and the world was more angular. You play as a chick who jumps across rooftops collecting stars while chasing down a being that has stolen his ice cream. It starts off cute, with pink skies and smiling faces, but things get weirdly sinister as you go on and you start getting chased by groaning, distorted stars. There are nine main levels with a few hidden remixed ones and the weight of Toree’s jump takes a little getting used to, but once you get going the flow and layout of each level is really satisfying. It’s no Mario, but the platforming could happily go toe-to-toe with other, costlier games in the genre.

4. WBSC eBaseball: Power Pros – Konami – 79p

There’s no way this game should be this cheap. At less than the cost of a bag of crisps, this cutesy but surprisingly complex baseball sim is a steal. OK, so you need to actually know a fair bit about the sport to make the most out of it, but with a surprisingly active community and loads of throwing, batting and fielding options to experiment with there’s a lot here to tuck into. A word of warning though: you will get absolutely battered in online matches – the existing playerbase is hardcore.

3. The Rusty Sword: Vanguard Island – Plow Games – 89p

A short, zelda-inspired action adventure game that sees you land on a small Island in search of treasure. With retro sprites and some lovely art, The Rusty Sword is surprisingly well-polished for such a tiny game. With just the one dungeon to explore, and only a few simple items such as bombs to break walls and a sword for attacking, there isn’t a lot here – I completed the whole thing in 30 minutes – but what is here it does well. The enemies provide a decent amount of challenge, as do the puzzles. It may be small, but it feels just right for the price point.

2. Nicky The Home Alone Golf Ball – QuByte Interactive – 89p

A neat find from the bargain bin of Nintendo eShop, this is essentially a mini golf game, but instead of windmills and water features, you have to putt your way out of a house and across town to reach the big boy’s golf club. It’s more than simply navigating through platforms – there are puzzles to solve along the way, and it can get quite challenging. Nicky, your weirdly anthropomorphised golf ball hero, can’t walk (despite having legs). Instead, you have to pick the right angle and strength of hit to knock him over plant pots and the like, or into rolling footballs to solve obstacles and reach your goal. It’s a really simple mechanic, but it works well and makes for a satisfying afternoon distraction.

1. Republique: Anniversary edition -Camouflaj – 82p

The pricing on this one has to be a mistake. They must have missed an extra zero, because this star-studded stealth game shouldn’t be this cheap. David Hayter and Jennifer Hale lend their voices to this tale of a young woman captured by a totalitarian regime trying to make her escape. You play by hopping between security cameras and computers, guiding her through a facility while avoiding detection. It’s definitely not the best stealth game out there, the camera angles can get frustrating and the story lacks any kind of subtlety, but for 82p you get a good 6-10 hours of a thoroughly decent game."

Yes we love the blossom of spring, and the long days of summer, but there’s something about the festive season that’s hard to beat.

Seeing the lights get turned on by a celebrity of varying levels of fame in your local town centre, a glass of mulled wine warming up your chilly hands at a Christmas market, and seeing the Christmas adverts appear on TV.

It is of course Mother Goose, starring the rather dazzling Sir Ian McKellen, as well as comedian John Bishop and former Great British Bake Off host Mel Giedroyc.

The Pantomime Adventure of Peter Pan at the Bristol Hippodrome, Bristol The adventure of Peter Pan is coming to Bristol this Christmas. The Bristol Hippodrome is one of our favourite venues, and it’ll be a great place to see the panto whether you’re based in the city or are travelling from further afield. This panto will be running from Saturday 2nd December until New Year’s Eve, and we expect the bigger nights to sell out fast. There isn’t much of a cast line up yet, but we’ll do our best to keep this page updated as new names come in.

Different generations love different cars, according to a new report by Insider, although some groups (millennials and boomers) are closer in taste than one would expect.

The Toyota Camry (the 2023 model starts at $26,200 while used versions from 2014 are going for about $9,000) is a favorite of Gen Z (aged 18 to 24) as are two other Toyota models. Millennials and older Boomers both love the Toyota RAV4, an SUV with outdoor and hybrid versions.

Generation X is driving the Chevrolet Silverado. Boomers, which were spilt into two categories, also liked the Ford F-Series, a.k.a., the Ford family of pickup trucks, like the F-150 LARIAT, whose 2023 model starts at over $57,000.

A report found that younger people are interested in Asian cars, particularly Toyotas.

“Gen–Z is the only generation who call for insurance quotes on more Asian cars than European,” the company wrote in a summary of the results.

Here’s a look at the most popular cars for each generation using registration data broken down by age group.

2023-03-25,2023-03-25 08:03:00,10 Tearful Goodbyes In Film,https://markmeets.com/movies/10-tearful-goodbyes-in-film/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-tearful-goodbyes-in-film,Sports,"Rom-coms and funny movies have their place, but sometimes you’re just in the mood to cry. Whether you’ve been dealing with heartbreak, illness, or you’re just feeling all the feelings, a tearjerker movie is sometimes exactly what you need to feel better. Luckily for you, we’ve rounded up sad movies so you can have a good cry or when the goodbye just get’s you.

In this year’s Marvel Studios blockbuster Thor: Love and Thunder, Odinson had to say goodbye to his old flame Jane Foster when she chose saving the Asgardian children kidnapped by Gorr the God Butcher over her own health. It was just the latest in a long line of heartbreaking goodbyes on the big screen.

From E.T.’s farewell to Elliott in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial to Andy’s farewell to his toys in Toy Story 3 to Truman Burbank’s farewell to his audience in The Truman Show, film history is full of heartbreaking goodbyes.

Toy Story 3

Andy Says Goodbye To His Toys

Woody’s farewell to Buzz at the end of Toy Story 4 was certainly a tearjerker, but the franchise already had the perfect ending when Andy passed on all his toys to Bonnie in Toy Story 3. There isn’t a dry eye in the audience when Andy drives off to college and Woody says, “So long, partner.”

Children and adults alike cry uncontrollably during this scene. Woody finally letting go of the past and recognizing that his time with Andy is over is the perfect resolution to the film’s emotional arc.

The Choice

Sophie is faced with the hardest decision imaginable at the end of Sophie’s Choice: she must decide which one of her two children to hand over to a Nazi soldier, and which one gets to live. If she doesn’t choose, both children will die. Watching the young daughter part from her mother is painful in every conceivable way.

In Lost In Translation

Bob Says Goodbye To Charlotte

Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation is a heartwarming tale about the friendship that blossoms between a fading movie star and a neglected young spouse as they wander around Tokyo. After feeling dissatisfied with their goodbye, Bob jumps out of his taxi to the airport, approaches Charlotte on a crowded street, embraces her, and whispers something inaudible in her ear.

The ambiguity of Bob’s final farewell to Charlotte – not knowing exactly what he said, but knowing it was perfect – makes this a beautiful ending.

Armageddon

Dad Gets to Say Goodbye to His Daughter in Armageddon

In order to save the world, Harry Stamper makes the ultimate sacrifice. Before he rides off into the eternal sunset, he says farewell to his daughter, Grace. Michael Bay’s Armageddon certainly has its flaws as a (disaster) movie. However, this tear-jerker of a goodbye scene is powerful enough to make even the darkest heart reach for a tissue.

Casablanca

Rick Says Goodbye To Ilsa

Michael Curtiz’s wartime romance Casablanca originated as a standard Hollywood production – it wasn’t a passion project; it was just a genre picture starring two actors under contract at the studio – but it ended up standing out as one of the greatest movies ever made.

After reconnecting with her old flame Rick throughout the movie, Ilsa has to choose between embarking on an adventure with her new lover and staying with Rick. She ultimately decides to leave. Realizing he has to let her go, Rick famously tells Ilsa, “We’ll always have Paris.”

Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan

Spock Says Goodbye To Kirk

Captain James T. Kirk and his trusty science officer Spock have one of the most iconic friendships in all of pop culture. In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, after defeating the titular baddie and saving the Enterprise, Spock dies of radiation poisoning while Kirk helplessly watches from the other side of a pane of glass.

Kirk’s half-Vulcan sidekick signs off with a logical but heartfelt farewell, telling his captain, “I have always been, and always shall be, your friend. Live long… and prosper.”

The Truman Show

Truman Says Goodbye To His Audience

This one isn’t a goodbye between two people, but rather between one person and one billion strangers. When Truman Burbank realizes he’s the star of a reality TV phenomenon at the end of Peter Weir’s The Truman Show, he sets sail into the “ocean” to find a way out of the dome where he’s spent his whole life under constant surveillance.

When he finally hits the wall, he finds a staircase leading up to the exit. Before leaving his artificial world to discover the real one, Truman says one last goodbye to his worldwide audience, using his catchphrase: “In case I don’t see you… good afternoon, good evening, and good night!”

Shane

Shane Says Goodbye To Joey

Over the course of George Stevens’ classic western Shane, the eponymous ex-gunslinger gets a job on a family’s ranch, develops a sweet father-son dynamic with their young son Joey, and protects them from a ruthless cattle baron. After defeating the cattle baron and his men in a shootout, Shane decides he has to move on.

Joey desperately wants Shane to stay, but Shane explains, “There’s no living with a killing,” and that he can’t escape his violent past to lead a peaceful life. As he rides off into the wilderness, Joey calls after him: “Shane, come back! Come back, Shane!”

Harold And Maude

Maude Says Goodbye To Harold

Hal Ashby’s delightfully dark romantic comedy Harold and Maude revolves around a 19-year-old boy who’s obsessed with death falling in love with a 79-year-old woman who embraces life. When Harold throws Maude the 80th birthday party of her dreams, he thinks it’ll convince her not to keep her promise to take her own life when she turns 80. But, midway through the party, during a tender romantic moment, Maude tells Harold she “couldn’t imagine a lovelier farewell.”

Harold is confused by the use of the word “farewell,” and Maude explains, “I took the tablets an hour ago. I’ll be gone by midnight.” Maude is at peace with the decision, but Harold is horrified. With pitch-perfect comic timing, he says, “WHAT!?” before Ashby cuts to a speeding ambulance."

You can never be entirely sure of what you’re getting yourself into. The potential for hidden problems and unnecessary expenses is real. However, with the right tools and tricks, you can avoid getting scammed and find the right used car.

In this post, we’ll discuss how to properly inspect used cars for sale in El Paso. From checking the exterior to taking a test drive, these tips will help you avoid unnecessary expenses.

Check The Exterior Of The Vehicle

The exterior of the car should be the first thing you inspect. Look for any dents, scratches, or rust. Any indication of a previous accident could indicate internal damage. Next, look around the car for paintwork or body panel inconsistencies.

Make sure the doors and trunk close correctly. Inspecting the tires for wear or damage is also a good idea. Bald tires indicate the car has been driven too hard or too often, and you’ll likely need to replace them soon.

Take A Test Drive

Taking a test drive is arguably the most essential part of the car-buying process. Listen carefully for sounds that might suggest a problem when starting the engine. Turn off the AC to make sure it’s not masking any noises.

Then, inspect the brakes and steering for any issues. Does the car pull to either side? Does it shake or vibrate when you brake? Finally, pay attention to how easy the car is to drive. Trust your instincts when determining if it feels right or not.

Inspect The Interior

Once you’re inside the car, take a closer look at the interior. Sit in all the seats, checking for any tears or damage. Turn on the AC to check the temperature and air output.

Other important areas to inspect are the dashboard, radio, and seats. Check for any unusual smells, which could signify a more significant problem. Finally, ensure all car functions, such as the power windows and locks, are working correctly.

Have A Professional Mechanic Inspect The Vehicle

Having a professional mechanic inspect the car before purchasing is always an excellent idea. The mechanic can provide an objective opinion on the car’s condition by checking it thoroughly.

Then, before agreeing to buy the vehicle, take it to the mechanic to ensure no hidden problems. It might seem annoying or time-consuming, but identifying issues before purchasing can save you thousands of dollars in the long run.

Make Sure All Paperwork Is In Order

Finally, ensure all the paperwork is in order before sealing the deal. Check the car title, registration, service records, and any warranties. Ensure no lien is against the vehicle and all taxes have been paid. There should be no surprises when it comes to purchasing used cars for sale El Paso. Don’t hesitate to ask the seller for clarification on any paperwork.

Trump has reportedly road-tested multiple derogatory nicknames for his potential 2024 GOP rival. In a preview of a “Piers Morgan Uncensored” interview that will air on Fox Nation Thursday, British media personality Morgan asked DeSantis which he preferred.

“Is it ‘Ron DeSanctimonious’ or ‘Meatball Ron’?” asked Morgan.

“I don’t know how to spell ‘DeSanctimonious.’ I don’t really know what it means,” DeSantis replied. “But you know, I kind of like it. It’s long. It’s got a lot of vowels. I mean, so, we’d go with that. That’s fine.”

“You know, you can call me whatever you want. I mean, just as long as you, you know, also call me a winner,” he added. “Because that’s what we’ve been able to do in Florida, is put a lot of points on the board and really take the state to the next level.”

Watch the clip here:

Ron DeSantis on his favourite nickname that Donald Trump has given him so far:

Elsewhere in the interview, DeSantis took a rare swipe at Trump and his dubious relationship with the truth.

Trump endorsed DeSantis for governor in 2018 but the former president has become increasingly hostile toward the governor amid reports of the latter’s own White House ambitions."

Trump on Saturday announced he’d be charged Tuesday in the Manhattan district attorney’s investigation into hush money payments allegedly paid to silence porn actor Stormy Daniels.

Steele, standing in for Chris Hayes as guest host on MSNBC’s “All In” on Tuesday, noted that the day came and went without Trump being hauled in.

“But we really shouldn’t be surprised, should we?” he asked. “It’s what Trump does. He punks everybody.”

So by the time the real story comes out, well, everyone is playing catch up.” pic.twitter.com/0JXeNhxJXr — All In with Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) March 22, 2023

“What we saw this weekend was Trump once again trying to frame the narrative before it could unfold,” explained Steele. “The ex-president was setting the tone and the outcome on his terms. So, by the time the real story comes out, well, everyone is playing catch-up.”

Following Trump’s arrest claim, people were “all following his lead instead of waiting for the Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg to set the facts straight,” Steele continued. “Did the DA’s office tell us? No. Trump did. He figured that, ‘Yeah, just make it up … Put it out there and everyone is going to feed off of it for a few days.’”"

The committee, which lists Trump-adoring Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) as its ranking member, on Tuesday quoted Jordan himself as saying: “We don’t think President Trump broke the law at all.”

It posted three fire emojis below.

Others edited the message, suggesting it could have stopped after three words: “We don’t think.”

Drew Findling is representing Trump as he seeks to fend off a potential indictment in Georgia, where a special purpose grand jury recently concluded a monthslong investigation into Trump’s efforts to pressure state officials to throw out Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the state. The Fulton County district attorney’s office is considering potential charges.

On Monday, Findling filed a motion to quash the special purpose grand jury’s report and to prohibit the Fulton County DA from filing charges related to it.

On MSNBC’s “The Beat” Tuesday, Melber pressed Findling to present his defense of Trump’s actions in Georgia, which included a phone call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump said he wanted to “find” the exact number of votes he needed to win.

“I’m not going to bear down on the specifics ... I will tell you, having looked at the evidence in this case, that there’s been no violations of the law,” Findling said.

Melber reminded Findling of his role in the case.

“You’re not the judge or the jury in this case. You’re the lawyer,” he said. “We’re talking to you not for your conclusions without evidence, but for the evidence you can marshal right now. I’m giving you the time. If you can’t do it tonight, if you can’t give us any arguments, then we will note that.”

Melber noted specific laws that Trump appears to have violated during taped conversations with state officials.

Findling insisted his client is “completely innocent.”

“I can tell you, we’re incredibly familiar with those statutes. They aren’t new to us. We do a lot of political cases,” he blustered. “We are absolutely confident having looked at the evidence that our client has not violated any of those.”

He didn’t provide said evidence.

At another point in the interview, Findling repeatedly refused to acknowledge whether Trump lost the election in Georgia.

In several all-caps screeds on his social media platform Saturday, the former president said he expected to be arrested on Tuesday at the direction of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office. Bragg has been investigating Trump’s role in a hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016.

“Protest, take our nation back,” Trump told his followers. In another post, he said that “evil & sinister people” were “killing our nation as we sit back and watch.”

“We must save America! Protest, protest, protest!!!” he wrote.

Sarah Matthews, who was deputy White House press secretary during the Trump administration, was asked during an appearance Tuesday on CNN if she was worried about the former president’s rhetoric.

“Definitely worried,” said Matthews, who resigned from the Trump administration on the day of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. “I think it goes to show he’s learned nothing in the aftermath of Jan. 6. The rhetoric he was using was similar to the rhetoric he used around Jan. 6. I think in his Truth Social post he said that they needed to protest to ‘take back our nation.’”

Sarah Matthews testified last July before the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the attack on Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. The Washington Post via Getty Images

“And so it does concern me to see him using that kind of rhetoric that could lead to a violent uptick,” she said, according to a clip of the interview published by Mediaite.

However, Matthews said she believed the response from supporters would likely be more muted than it was on Jan. 6, 2021."

Talking Points: What are the DFL’s and GOP’s plans for the state’s budget surplus?

Talking Points: What are the DFL’s and GOP’s plans for the state’s budget surplus?

ST. PAUL, Minn. - Democratic legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz agreed Tuesday on broad budget targets that add up to nearly $17.9 billion in new spending, including $3 billion for tax cuts, but the details of where the money will go remain to be negotiated.

Agreeing on the targets was a necessary step so that legislators can begin work in earnest on setting a balanced state budget for the next two years.

The agreement does not specify how they'll cut taxes by $3 billion out of the state's $17.5 billion budget surplus. House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, indicated she has softened on the governor's proposal for direct tax rebate checks, saying there's ""definitely room"" for ""nice-sized checks"" in the targets and there's a ""commitment to do something"" about taxation of Social Security.

Republicans, whose influence is limited this session, have pushed for full elimination of the state's partial income tax on Social Security benefits. Some Democrats who won in tough districts and helped their party take control of the Senate and keep the House support elimination as well.

Other highlights include:

- $2.2 billion in new spending for K-12 education and pre-kindergarten

- $1.2 billion for children and families

- $100 million for broadband expansion

- $1 billion for housing

- $255 million for energy and climate

- $650 million for public safety

- $2.3 billion for infrastructure projects

- $40 million for disaster relief in anticipation of significant spring flooding.

Republican leaders said the targets include too much spending and not enough tax relief.

""Today's budget targets are a reflection of how Democrats have become all too comfortable with their one-party rule,"" House Republican Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said in a statement. ""Instead of listening to Minnesotans and proposing a responsible budget with meaningful tax relief, Democrats are going on a spending spree.""

Senate Republicans last week blocked a $1.9 billion public infrastructure borrowing package known as a bonding bill. The $2.3 million target for infrastructure would be an ""all-cash bonding bill"" that wouldn't require GOP votes to achieve the three-fifths supermajority to approve borrowing.

Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, of Minneapolis, said the infrastructure target ensures that the Legislature can deliver on a ""robust"" capital investment bill, with or without GOP support."
2023-03-22,2023-03-22 01:58:17,Republicans Are Convinced An Indictment Would Help Donald Trump,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-indictment-republicans_n_641a3c37e4b01ea5cd90d75a,Politics,"WASHINGTON ― No former president has ever been indicted before in U.S. history, but the prospect of Donald Trump being the first elicited little, if any, alarm among members of his party on Capitol Hill.

Asked about the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination potentially facing jail time in New York over his role in a hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, Republican lawmakers insisted that an indictment would actually help Trump in 2024.

“Ironically, this left-wing [district attorney] could play a pivotal role in reelecting Donald Trump as president,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) predicted on Tuesday, referring to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. “It is likely to rally Republican primary voters behind Trump.”

Even Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Trump critic, acknowledged the possibility that a criminal indictment could aid Trump’s quest for a second term. The Alaska Republican laughed when asked to comment on the “surreal” situation, ably summing up the absurdity of the moment.

“Only Trump could be helped by an indictment,” Murkowski told HuffPost, throwing up her hands and shaking her head in seeming disbelief. “Seriously, just listen to your question. I don’t mean to be funny, but [for] any other person, an indictment is not a way to win an election.”

Bragg is investigating Trump over the former president’s role in a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels in 2016 ahead of the presidential election. Daniels said she had sex with Trump in 2006, while Trump has denied the allegation.

A grand jury convened by Bragg could vote on whether to indict Trump as early as this week. The former president claimed over the weekend that he would soon be arrested, urging his supporters to take to the streets in protest.

Whether an indictment could help or hurt Trump politically has been a matter of hot debate in Washington, with cases for both outcomes in several newspapers. It certainly seems likely that charges brought forward by a New York prosecutor would benefit Trump in the immediate GOP primary. Rivals have already rushed to his defense, and he isn’t missing an opportunity to make multiple appeals for funding.

It’s less clear how an indictment would affect Trump’s chances in a general election, which is still more than a year away. He lost to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race in part because of Trump fatigue among a wary slice of the GOP electorate. More legal troubles ― in New York, in Georgia, and potentially within the Department of Justice ― could amplify that problem.

“Only Trump could be helped by an indictment. I don’t mean to be funny, but [for] any other person, an indictment is not a way to win an election.” - Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska)

One thing that is evident is that Trump continues to hold a powerful grip on the GOP establishment. He’s the first president to be impeached twice by the House of Representatives, and the first to have tried to overturn an election he lost, leading to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Yet Republican lawmakers are still rallying to his defense and attacking a local prosecutor before he’s even unveiled charges against his target.

“A Trump indictment would be a disgusting abuse of power. The DA should be put in jail,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) tweeted on Tuesday.

When a reporter asked Paul what law Bragg had violated in order to deserve said jail time, the senator declined to state.

“I think we’ll stick with just what we tweeted out,” he told CNN.

Other Republicans have claimed Bragg was leading a politically motivated investigation that hinged on an untested legal theory dealing with falsifying business records to cover up a federal crime.

“We’re not talking about a local prosecutor going after, you know, a criminal. ... We’re talking about someone going after a former president,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told reporters.

Top Democrats, meanwhile, were tight-lipped when asked about the potential Trump indictment and how it may affect the 2024 presidential race. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Gary Peters (D-Mich.) both declined to comment on Tuesday.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) also said he didn’t wish to speculate, but he suggested that any legal investigation involving a former president should be airtight before proceeding to court.

“I’ve always been of the opinion that if and when any one of these cases come to pass, I’d hope that prosecutors have all their ducks in a row,” Warner told HuffPost.

“This is an example of why Donald Trump is full of it when he says there’s a ‘deep state,’ because there’s no coordination between the ongoing cases happening right now,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added when asked if he had concerns that charging Trump over allegedly falsifying business records could dampen public reaction to other possible indictments against him, including his role in the Jan. 6 riot.

Other Democrats argued that not prosecuting Trump because of politics would undermine America’s legal system and that an indictment would ultimately cost him.

“It’s hard to make ‘convicted of a crime’ a good look,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told HuffPost.

“He has to face the consequences of his actions,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “As long as the prosecutors are doing the right thing, I think it’s the right thing to do, and in the end, it will be the right thing politically.”

Only Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a moderate who is weighing whether to run for reelection in a state where Trump is very popular, suggested caution because an indictment could have a “reverse effect.”"
2023-03-22,2023-03-22 01:47:06,Ron DeSantis Goes After Trump In Interview With Piers Morgan,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ron-desantis-trump-piers-morgan_n_641a5468e4b0bc5cb653285c,Politics,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) issued some rare criticism of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, saying truth is an “essential” quality in a leader and contrasting his potential rival with the character of the Founding Fathers.

DeSantis spoke with British journalist Piers Morgan as part of a sweeping interview about his presidential ambitions. The governor has largely avoided needling Trump but took swipes at the former president’s leadership style and his legal woes surrounding a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016.

“At the end of the day, as a leader you really want to look to people like our Founding Fathers,” DeSantis said. “It’s not saying that you don’t ever make a mistake in your personal life, but I think, what type of character are you bringing? … I think the person is more about how you handle your public duties and the kind of character you bring to that endeavor.”

DeSantis also pointed to Trump’s leadership style, backing away from what he called the former president’s “daily drama.”

“You bring your own agenda in, you’re gone,” he said. “We’re just not going to have that. So, the way we run the government, I think, is no daily drama, focus on the big picture and put points on the board, and I think that’s something that’s very important.”

He went on to say that voters needed to “agree that there’s a certain reality to the world we live in,” an apparent dig at Trump’s penchant for lies and misinformation after his 2020 reelection loss.

“Truth is essential,” DeSantis said. “We have to agree that there’s a certain reality to the world we live in, and if we can just create our own facts, then we’re never going to be able to agree on anything or never really be able to do policy in a way that makes sense, and so, yes, it’s not your truth or my truth, it’s the truth.”

Despite that sentiment, the governor said that were he in charge during the COVID-19 pandemic, he would have fired Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top expert on infectious diseases.

Trump and DeSantis were always going to have to get in the ring to decide who’ll be the Republican nominee. Safe to say, I think my interview with @GovRonDeSantis has sounded the bell for Round One. It airs on @PiersUncensored on Thursday, and it’s a cracking watch. #DingDing 🔔 pic.twitter.com/HrcGntnLFP — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) March 21, 2023

The interview — published in the New York Post, a key tentpole in Rupert Murdoch’s media empire — came just hours after DeSantis took a not-so-subtle jab at Trump’s potential indictment related to the Daniels hush money case.

“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,” DeSantis said Monday during a news conference. “I just, I can’t speak to that.”

The governor did level criticism at the Manhattan district attorney and suggested the investigation is politically motivated. But his statement prompted immediate outrage from the former president.

“Ron DeSanctimonious will probably find out about FALSE ACCUSATIONS & FAKE STORIES sometime in the future, as he gets older, wiser, and better known, when he’s unfairly and illegally attacked by a woman, even classmates that are ‘underage’ (or possibly a man!),” Trump raged on his Truth Social media network. “I’m sure he will want to fight these misfits just like I do!”

DeSantis added that the barbs about his name don’t bother him, saying it wasn’t important for him “to be fighting with people on social media.”

“To me, it’s just background noise,” the governor said."

It involves the use of government spending, taxation and borrowing to influence economic growth, stabilize inflation and maintain a stable economy. This article will explain what fiscal policy is, how it works, and why it is important.

What is fiscal policy?

Fiscal policy is a tool used by governments to regulate economic activities in their country. It is one of the two main categories of economic policy, along with monetary policy. The main goal of fiscal policy is to control the economy through government spending and taxation.

How does fiscal policy work?

The government has a number of ways to affect the economy through fiscal policy. One of the primary methods used is government spending. The government may boost economic activity and create jobs by raising spending, which will add more money to the economy.

Another way that fiscal policy works is through taxation. The government can boost disposable income, which in turn can boost consumer spending, by decreasing taxes. This could encourage economic expansion and boost activity.

Important old chart of mine.



Fiscal policy created inflation to a much larger extent than QE pic.twitter.com/zeT5jLqwVA — AndreasStenoLarsen (@AndreasSteno) March 18, 2023

Finally, fiscal policy is also used for controlling inflation. If the government considers inflation to be a concern, it may raise taxes or cut spending, both of which could help to lower demand and limit inflation.

Why is fiscal policy important?

Fiscal policy is important because it can have a significant impact on the economy. By adjusting government spending and taxation, the government can influence economic growth, inflation and employment levels.

Stimulating economic growth

The promotion of economic growth is one of fiscal policy’s main goals. The government can promote economic activity and employment by raising spending. As a result, there may be an increase in tax collections and corporate and individual chances for growth in the economy.

Regulating inflation

Inflation control is another key responsibility of fiscal policy. When there is an excess of money chasing an insufficient amount of goods, inflation can result in price increases. The government can lower demand by altering expenditure and taxation, which can aid in reducing inflation.

Reducing employment

Furthermore, fiscal policy can be used to reduce unemployment. The government can promote economic activity and employment by raising spending. As a result, there may be less unemployment and more options for employment.

Managing debt

Fiscal policy can also be used to manage government debt. By adjusting government spending and taxation, the government can influence the amount of money it borrows. This can help manage the government’s debt levels and ensure that it is able to meet its financial obligations.

• Senate corporate tax MTA surcharge: $930M for MTA pic.twitter.com/zj4gYE319K — Fiscal Policy Institute (@NYFiscalPolicy) March 16, 2023

Do cryptocurrencies have a fiscal policy?

Due to their decentralization and lack of centralized management, cryptocurrencies do not have a fiscal policy in the conventional sense. Yet the supply and demand of some cryptocurrencies may be impacted by the fact that they may have their own distinct monetary policies and rules written into their code.

Related: Ethereum as a deflationary asset, explained

For example, Bitcoin (BTC) has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins, which is hardcoded into its blockchain protocol. This means that no more than 21 million BTC can ever be created, and this limit helps to regulate its supply and demand.

Even though cryptocurrencies lack a traditional fiscal policy, the rules and protocols incorporated into their coding can nonetheless significantly affect their adoption and value. For instance, alterations to the supply or consensus algorithm of a cryptocurrency may have an impact on its security and scarcity, which may have an impact on its price and market demand.

He was the last surviving member of the Intel Trinity, which also included his fellow founder Robert Noyce and their first hire Andy Grove. Moore and Noyce previously worked with the co-inventor of the transistor, William Shockley, before helping found Fairchild Semiconductor. In 1968, the two struck out on their own and founded NM Electronics, which eventually became Intel.

A few years before that, in 1965, Moore wrote a paper that envisioned the miniaturization of computers. To be precise, he predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every year, leading to the creation and production of smaller and more powerful chips that would, in turn, enable advancements in technology. His prediction was dubbed ""Moore's Law,"" and it was proven accurate in the years that followed. By 1975, he adjusted his estimate for the doubling of transistors to every two years, though now top chipmakers disagree on whether Moore's Law still holds.

In 1979, Moore was named chairman of the board and CEO at Intel before giving up the latter role in 1987. He apparently served as mediator between Noyce and Grove, and he and Grove were the ones who decided that Intel would focus on microprocessors instead of continuing with its memory business. The rest, as they say, is history. Before Moore completely stepped down from his duties at Intel in 2006, he and his wife established the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation with $5 billion in funding. The foundation supported environmental conservation efforts, mostly in the San Francisco Bay area, and donated to various educational institutions' science and technology departments.

However, the collector intended to borrow some money against it to buy another NFT.

NFT collector Brandon Riley added CryptoPunk #685 to his collection on March 13 by paying 77 ETH, hoping to hold it for the long term.

Now feels like an appropriate time to introduce #BAYC 586 to #Punk 685 (acquired a week ago). Hope to hold both for a decade… LGF! pic.twitter.com/SLb68rY6MR — Brandon Riley (@vitalitygrowth) March 19, 2023

As a seasoned investor, Riley knew the importance of procuring new NFTs right before crypto markets took off into a new bull market. As a result, he decided to borrow some money against CryptoPunk #685 by using a popular technique known as wrapping.

I did do the first part with my own address I’m step 2. But then when I got to step 5 the burn address was the one listed under “9. proxyInfo” and I was told to follow the directions exactly, so I did. I just shouldn’t have attempted this on my own I guess. — Brandon Riley (@vitalitygrowth) March 24, 2023

While going through the unfamiliar process of wrapping NFTs, Riley accidentally sent the asset to a burn address — which permanently deleted the NFT from circulation, as shown below.

“I was told to follow the directions exactly, so I did,” explained Riley, but in the process, he ended up losing 77 ETH, which was worth $135,372.16. He explained:

“I was not wrapping this punk to sell it on Blur. It was to be my “forever punk.” The number is exact reverse of my ape. I was only wrapping it because I needed to borrow some liquidity from it.”

While members of Crypto Twitter believed that the NFT collector must have had “deep pockets,” Riley contradicted the rumors by revealing that he had purchased CryptoPunk #685 through borrowed money.

“I just shouldn’t have attempted this on my own, I guess,” was Riley’s takeaway from the experience. On the other hand, Crypto Twitter also blamed confusing user interfaces and complex instructions for the investor’s loss. As a result, the community unanimously agreed on the need to revamp the front-end processes for crypto ecosystems.

The SEC issued Coinbase a Wells notice on March 22 outlining that SEC staff had recommended the agency take enforcement action over “possible violations of securities laws” concerning some of the firm’s asset listings, staking services and Coinbase Wallet.

In a March 23 blog post titled, “Europe is winning. Will the US catch up?” Daniel Seifert, Coinbase’s vice president and regional managing director in Europe, stressed that the U.S.’s “regulatory approach to crypto has been marked by regulation by enforcement,” despite industry-wide calls for “comprehensive crypto regulation.”

“This approach has created an environment of uncertainty and instability in the crypto industry,” he wrote.

Coinbase’s top lawyer @iampaulgrewal says the SEC wants court fights instead of conversation.



In dozens of meetings with the SEC over the last 9 months, Grewal says the exchange was “given essentially no response” to key questions.



Listen:https://t.co/027slXaMhb pic.twitter.com/L0ikJwleyA — Laura Shin (@laurashin) March 24, 2023

As such, Seifert argued that the U.S. is losing its status as the leading hub of the crypto sector, while France, the U.K. and the European Union are now building “vibrant” ecosystems due to their friendlier approach to crypto regulation.

“The US has left a vacuum that other countries are eager to fill,” he wrote, adding: “we are proudly an American company. It’s hard to sit by and watch the US squander the opportunity it has been given.”

Yes yes very normal and totally rational — sassal.eth (@sassal0x) March 23, 2023

In particular, Seifert highlighted the significance of Paris Blockchain Week hosted at the Louvre this month. He also pointed to the U.K.’s recent push to become a crypto hub, and the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, slated to come into effect in 2024.

“This year it’s being held in a private space at the Louvre, arguably the greatest national treasure in France and one of the world’s most respected museums,” he said, adding:

“To me this is a clear signal: France is rapidly recognizing the opportunity that crypto presents and is offering it space to flourish. The broader EU, the UK, UAE, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and Japan are all following suit.”

The MiCA legislation has been in development for two years, and aims to establish a “harmonized set of rules for crypto-assets and related activities and services.”

It is generally expected to be a positive move for the European cryptocurrency ecosystem, as it will offer clear rules and guidelines for the sector.

“Already we are seeing that Europe now matches the US in its share of crypto developers (29% apiece globally). The US used to lead the charge with 40%,” he said, adding that:

“This level of growth does not happen by chance. Concerted efforts have to be made, such as developing a regulatory framework that will provide clarity and stability for businesses operating in the space.”

In a lengthy March 23 Twitter thread, the Crypto Council for Innovation also highlighted similar points to Seifert, commenting that “crypto is global, and nobody is waiting around for the US to land the plane.”

The thread explored positive developments globally, including examples such as the National Australia Bank’s work with non-U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, Hong Kong’s efforts to become a digital asset hub, and the Canadian Securities Administration recently imposing “enhanced investor protection commitments” on domestic crypto exchanges."

Binion’s casino downtown removed a sign warning members of motorcycle clubs about its “no color” policy after attracting unexpected attention on Twitter, a hotel spokesman said Friday.

Tim Lager, Binion’s general manager, said the hotel put up the sign last weekend, following a briefing from the Metropolitan Police Department about the potential for bikers coming into town.

“It’s what everyone does when you get intel from Metro that there is going to be biker activity,” he said.

The message it conveys is that “Hey, we’ve got a no color policy in place,” Lager said, adding, however, that the casino forgot to take down the sign over the next few days.

It might not have made waves this week had it not been for a random missive posted Wednesday on Twitter by local account Vital Vegas, which is run by Scott Roeben.

The photo ultimately garnered 165,000 views.

“I was honestly shocked it got the reaction it got,” Roeben said in an interview. “I think a lot of people were trying to be funny.”

But there’s nothing new about “no color” policies in Las Vegas casinos, which are intended to take aim at biker clubs. The text of the Binion’s sign itself goes back as far as 15 years, Metro police spokesman Officer Bob Wicks said.

Club affiliation

The term “colors” refers to emblems or badges on a biker’s vest that symbolize their club affiliation, which could trigger a negative reaction from a rival member and cause trouble, Wicks said.

While the Binion’s sign contains a reference to Las Vegas police, “we don’t have anything to do with that sign as far as their private policy,” Wicks said. “They’re allowed to have whatever restrictions they want.”

The department routinely delivers intelligence to Strip and downtown casinos about pending visits from biker groups, including for events such as the annual Las Vegas Bikefest, Wick said.

“We have to protect the public, that’s the end game,” he said. “All we want is it to be a safe environment.”

Before being removed from the casino floor, the Binion’s sign read: “In cooperation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, as well as for your fun, enjoyment, and safety, the Fremont Street Experience Member Properties hereby adopt and enforce the following: No Color Policy.”

The sign goes on to list prohibited items, such as any clothing, decal or insignia “that suggests, states, displays, endorses, supports for, membership in, or endorsement of any motorcycle club, gang, association, or organization.”

Binion’s is part of a private organization of 10 casinos that manages the Fremont Street Experience, a five-block-long pedestrian mall and light show on Fremont Street downtown.

Like any private business, Binion’s has the right to refuse service to anyone, including those who go against the “no color” policy, Wick said.

If someone did not follow the rules, Binion’s could call police, who may cite them for misdemeanor trespassing, handcuff them and physically remove them from the property, he said.

17:04 Cheap Fast Eats #6: K-Town, After Dark!

Koreatown is one of the more dense, diverse, and complex neighborhoods of Los Angeles.

Composed of the four major thoroughfares of Olympic, Western, Beverly and 3rd Street, it makes sense that when Hollywood needs a stand-in for New York, film and television crews come to K-Town to achieve its facsimile.

Walking along the crowded streets after battling it out looking for parking — which seems to serve as a Koreatown rite of passage — we’re reminded of the ending of the 2015 documentary City of Gold about food writer Jonathan Gold, who lived in the neighborhood following the 1992 uprising.

Gold paints a picture of a hodgepodge of cultures coexisting almost on top of each other — Asian, Latino, Black and white in once-grand, now slightly crumbling large 1930s apartment buildings, with the sites of formerly impressive venues such as the Coconut Grove (housed at the famed Ambassador Hotel ), mishmashed against post-modern designed buildings (like everyone’s favorite KFC ).

Koreatown comes alive at night, with its bright lights and big-city feel, with certain bars and restaurants staying open well into the wee hours of the morning .

So, for this edition of Cheap Fast Eats, we decided to venture into the night to help you discover some tasty, eclectic, easy-on-the-wallet dining options.

(If you end up calling in late to work the next day, you can blame it on us.)

Zzamong

Advertised as a Chinese restaurant per its signage, Zzamong doubles as a Chinese-Korean restaurant, featuring a menu with dishes from both countries. There’s the silky-meets-spicy plates of mapo tofu, and savory-sweet helpings of japchae noodles, but it’s another noodle dish that’s always caught our attention — the jjajangmyun (or jjajangmyeon), a dish that was created in Korea by Chinese immigrants.

The fermented black bean saucy dish is packed with salty umami flavors, mixed with a bounty of chew-tastic noodles that, when served, are so long and thick, the wait staff provide kitchen scissors to cut them for a more manageable bite.

It’s customary to mix the sauce — a viscous mix of soy sauce and oyster sauce — with the noodles, to make everything uniform before delivering it to your gullet.

Traditionally made with pork, their jjajangmyun can also be prepared vegan, as well as in different sizes and price points. It makes Zzamong a perfect place to satisfy your cravings after catching a show at the Wiltern or visiting some of our favorite dive bar haunts, such as Blipsy Bar and Frank N’ Hank .

Zzamong is located in an unassuming strip mall, another type of architecture that dominates the K-town landscape. What the location might lack in curb appeal is made up in what’s best described as table-side antics, supplied by wait staff who take it upon themselves to entertain diners by spinning trays filled with plastic cups or creating origami out of discarded receipt papers. All the while, a booming soundtrack of contemporary indie rock plays loudly, which seems a bit out of place given the surroundings — but who are we to question when the noodles are this good?

Two Hands Seoul Fresh Corn Dogs

Sure, we’ve all had a corn dog before, but more recently, Korean-style corn dogs have begun to inhabit our shores, creating a stir with their distinct textures.

The Two Hands establishment is a perfect example, poised for world domination as the chain catches on in shopping mall-like spaces throughout SoCal.

We visited their Koreatown location on Western, situated on the third floor of California Marketplace, whose bottom floor is occupied by a supermarket (which you may remember from our first Snacking in the City installment).

Make your way past the snack aisle and go up a couple of floors, and you’ll find a delightful al fresco food court with a nice selection of outdoor seating, many occupied by families and young people chowing down on these delicious Korean corn dog creations.

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the number of options at Two Hands. First, select the outer toppings: Some standouts include the Two Hands dog with sweet ranch sauce, or the Spicy Dog, featuring a combination of Two Hands spicy sauce and hot Cheetos powder, to name a few. Then, you need to pick the contents of your dog which include half hot dog, half mozzarella cheese, a spicy hot dog and a plant-based option.

It makes for a sweet, crunchy, chewy creation that serves as the perfect accompaniment for a visit to K-town at night — or any time of day.

Pizza Baby

What is it about ghost kitchens these days? The commercial kitchen spaces that exclusively offer pick-up and delivery, with no dine-in.

In Los Angeles, already known for entry-level additions to the restaurant business, the ghost kitchen provides a new frontier for chefs and cooks looking to capture the hearts and stomachs of hungry eaters without the high overhead costs a brick-and-mortar establishment can bring.

Chefs Janet Kang and Robin Kloess, who met while at culinary school a few decades back, are very much in this camp, with their new operation offering some of the more creative pizza pies we’ve had in recent memory.

Kang and Kloess formed a bond when they were both making pizzas in San Francisco. The two had had their fill of the male-dominated restaurant industry and wanted to create something for themselves that was reflective of their own experiences and cultural backgrounds.

Enter Pizza Baby, with an emphasis on seasonality and flavors that aren’t specifically Italian, but more what they describe as “Asian American pizza.""

Take, for example, their kimchi margherita pizza, which contains equal parts tomato sauce and kimchi, both homemade and layered in holy matrimony. Gochujang and fish sauce add a bit of fermented funk, which, along with melted mozzarella and hints of basil, make for an extremely fresh and satisfying bite.

Another option to consider is the Rose Marzano, which contains a tomato tteokbokki sauce, usually found in a Korean rice cake dish, but found here instead playing nicely with a touch of cream and melted bits of smoked mozzarella. With such flavor-forward offerings as these, it’s almost impossible to go wrong.

The pizza crust also deserves mention, an immediate standout upon first bite, conjuring up comparisons to both the thin, crispy textures of New York-style pizza and the soft airiness of Napoletana-style pies.

Kang and Kloess say customers use pick-up as much as delivery; so

think of Pizza Baby as a drive-up pizza window, (which sounds like a uniquely Los Angeles experience), a perfect stop before painting K-town a nice color of pizza-sauce red.

Guelaguetza

How does one begin to capture the essence of a place like Guelaguetza, one of the premier eateries in Los Angeles? The heart of Oaxacalifornia, the large population of people hailing from one of Mexico’s most southern states, with the name Guelaguetza in the indigenous Zapotec language translating as ""to give and receive,"" usually used to describe the act of giving to one another during times of celebration.

In the case of the Lopez family (now in its second generation), which owns and operates the restaurant on Olympic Boulevard, the name perfectly sums up the vibe cultivated on any given night.

For many of us who grew up in Los Angeles, Guelaguetza serves as an introduction to the food of Oaxaca, illustrating how not all food from Mexico is the same. Even in the state of Oaxaca itself, diverse foodways exist reflecting the individual Chinateco, Triqui and Mixteco cultures, to name a few.

A server delivers food to diners inside of Guelaguetza in Koreatown. (Brian Feinzimer / LAist)

It’s the type of a place that’s perfect for large get-togethers such as family gatherings and work dinners, due to the sheer volume of some of the bigger family-style dishes, which, for good reason, tend to be at a higher price point. (It’s something that Guelaguetza has in common with many Korean-owned establishments in the neighborhood). That being said, there are plenty of good options for individual plates that are guaranteed to fill you up.

Start with the traditional Oaxacan entree section of the menu. A great example is the memelas, griddled disks made from fresh masa that feature crispy, almost burnt edges, smeared with aciento, a paste made from chicharrón — aka pork rind and black beans.

Chapulines (crickets) eaten inside of a tortilla at Guelaguetza in Koreatown. (Brian Feinzimer / LAist)

You can then add cecina, a thin cut of pork rubbed with chile guajillo adobo sauce, chorizo, or a large helping of Oaxacan cheese. Also consider the Tamal Oaxaqueño de mole negro con pollo (Oaxacan tamal with black mole and chicken) that’s wrapped in banana leaf, adding to its already complex flavor and big enough for two people to share.

Finally, no trip to Guelaguetza is complete without sampling one of the more famous antojitos on the menu — the chapulines, or grasshoppers. The protein-rich snack is a great dish to order, especially for those who are visiting Guelaguetza for the first time. You may be squeamish, but trust us, it’s worth it. Dried and then roasted with morita chiles, sea salt and lime, they deliver a umami crunchy bite that works perfectly, either folded inside thick handmade tortillas or popped into your mouth while sipping on some mezcal or horchata.

LOVE HOUR

Born just prior to the pandemic, LOVE HOUR is a smashburger pop-up that’s the brainchild of friends Jimmy Han, Mike Pak, and Duy Nguyen, who wanted to feed the community of Koreatown while offering a place to hang out.

The LOVE HOUR burger is a perfect example of the L.A.-style smashburger that currently dominates our culinary landscape. As far as burger patty intake is concerned, the best option is the double. All burgers come on a soft and squishy Martin’s potato roll, with cheese, diced white onion, house pickles, and their signature Love sauce.

If smashburgers aren’t your thing, LOVE HOUR also offers crispy hot honey chicken sandwiches or the fish filet sandwich that’s made with melted American cheese and tasty tartar sauce. There’s also an assortment of fries and onion rings, with added seasonings like sour cream and onion, bbq, and garlic parmesan. You could also opt for any one of their stellar dipping sauces such as the honey sambal sauce, which is one of our favorite tastes in recent memory.

LOVE HOUR is currently open Wednesdays - Saturdays at the Koreatown walk-up window location on Western, and on Sundays at Smorgasburg LA.

The Koreatown location provides a cool open-air space that makes you feel like you’re in the middle of the action that Koreatown offers. Recently, the owner also opened up a bar serving a selection of craft beers and natural wines, only adding to the overall sense of conviviality.

We all have our indulgences: A big bowl of chocolate ice cream after a long, stressful day. That can of Coke with a few slices of pizza on a Friday night. A burger and fries at that new restaurant everyone’s been raving about.

The saying “everything in moderation” exists for a reason. Most doctors and nutritionists know that completely depriving yourself of foods you love will backfire, causing you to eat way more of them than you should. But there are certain foods that gastroenterologists — doctors who specialize in keeping your gut and digestive tract healthy — avoid 99% (and sometimes 100%) of the time.

None of these foods will take years off your life if you eat them now and then, but there are certain foods GI docs rarely eat. Here are six of them.

Protein bars

Protein bars are healthy, right? While some — like the ones made with real fruit and nuts — are better than others, Dr. Harmony Allison, a gastroenterologist at Tufts Medical Center, says she never eats the highly processed ones. In particular, super-processed protein bars can lead to bloating and gas. “I never eat ‘protein’ bars. They tend to be highly processed and contain lots of additives that are of unknown utility,” she said. “You can get the same amount of protein in a cup of milk, a serving of peanut butter, nuts or pumpkin seeds.”

Steak

Sorry, red meat lovers: GI docs are not fans. “I avoid red meat, especially steaks and burgers,” said Dr. Reezwana Chowdhury, a gastroenterologist at Johns Hopkins. “Red meat and processed meat increase the risk of colon cancer and colon polyps. They are high in saturated fats, but if you are going to consume them, the amount consumed is important: The risk of colon cancer is higher in those who consume greater than 100 grams per day (that’s just under a quarter of a pound).”

Carol Yepes via Getty Images Eating processed meats, like hot dogs, four or more times per week can result in as high as a 20% increased risk of colon cancer.

Hot dogs and other processed meats

There are few people who have an easy time turning down a few pieces of fragrant bacon or a hot dog, but Dr. Rabia De Latour, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, steers clear of processed meats like these — and sadly, cold cuts count, too. “Red and processed meats have a higher risk of colorectal cancer,” she said. “Data has linked the ingestion of red and processed meats four or more times per week to as high as a 20% increased risk of colon cancer.”

Deep-fried fish or chicken

That Filet-O-Fish and carton of chicken nuggets are delicious and all, but they’re not doing your gut health any favors.

“Studies have shown that frying oil could adversely modulate the gut microbiome, leading to exacerbation of atherosclerosis (buildup of fat and other substances on the artery walls),” explained Dr. Mahmoud Ghannoum, a microbiome researcher and co-founder of BIOHM. Long term, this buildup can lead to consequences like heart attack and stroke.

Soda

If you’re a regular consumer of soda or any other type of sugar drink, it may be time to ditch that habit. “While they can be easy on the way down, these drinks are linked to chronic conditions as well, such as diabetes and heart disease,” said Dr. Simon C. Matthews, a gastroenterologist at Johns Hopkins and advisory board member to Vivante Health. “In addition, they are often associated with triggering gastrointestinal symptoms of bloating, burping and reflux, particularly when combined in their carbonated and caffeinated forms.”

White bread

According to Dr. Shilpa Grover, the director of the onco-gastroenterology program in the division of gastroenterology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, refined grains aren’t great for your gut.

“Studies that have evaluated dietary patterns have clearly shown that a high intake of red and processed meat and refined grains is associated with an increased risk of [inflammatory pouches in the digestive tract] called diverticulitis,” she said. “Contrary to what was thought earlier, nuts, corn, and popcorn are not associated with an increase in the risk of developing diverticulosis, or complications like diverticulitis or bleeding.”

But your gut health isn’t all you have to watch out for when it comes to eating a diet high in red meat and refined grains. “Those same diets recommended to decrease the risk of health conditions such as diabetes, coronary artery disease and cancer, including colorectal cancer, are also likely to decrease the risk of diverticulitis,” she said."
2023-03-24,2023-03-23 06:00:02,‘You’ve never eaten a banana?!’ 10 writers face their fiercest – and strangest – food fears,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/23/youve-never-eaten-a-banana-10-writers-face-their-fiercest-and-strangest-food-fears,Food,"‘Bananas are mushy, musty and alarmingly yellow’

It’s not because they look phallic, OK? There is nothing Freudian or weird about the fact that I have spent my life recoiling at the sight of a banana. My banana aversion has nothing to do with me being gay. I like cucumbers! I like courgettes! I have no problem with phallic produce.

Anyway, there shouldn’t be any need for psychosexual explanations; it should be perfectly obvious to everyone that bananas are repulsive. They’re mushy, they’re musty, they’re alarmingly yellow. I wouldn’t go so far as to say I have bananaphobia (a rare but real condition), but for a long time I was so nauseated by the fruit that you couldn’t have paid me a million dollars to touch one.

‘It took me a few days to work up the courage’ … Arwa with the dreaded fruit. Photograph: courtesy of Arwa Mahdawi

Now, however, I have accepted a far smaller sum to try one. Is this personal growth, or an abandonment of personal dignity? Either way, my small child is partly to blame. One thing I hadn’t anticipated about motherhood was how many bananas would be involved. I have had to feed my kid “nanas” so many times that my fear of them has dissipated slightly.

Still, it took me a few days to work up the courage to do the deed. For a brief moment, I thought about cheating and pretending that I’d done it. Obviously, I’m far too ethical for that, but I did make sure to negotiate the terms with my editor. “Do I have to eat the whole thing?” I asked. “Just do your best and give it a go,” I was told. OK, I thought. Just the tip. I can do that.

“Oh my God, I can’t believe you’re doing this!” said my wife as I took my first nibble. And you know what? It wasn’t as bad as I expected. I mean, yes, it was extremely disgusting, but it was disgusting with creamy undertones and hints of … I took another little nibble … were those notes of apricot? I will never know, because two small bites were all I could stomach. I rushed to the sink and washed my mouth out.

In the end, it was a repulsive but enlightening experiment. My two main takeaways are:

1) Always trust your gut – if you hate something, there is probably a good reason.

2) I should have asked for hazard pay. Arwa Mahdawi

‘Maybe the real reason I avoided chip butties was self-preservation’

It’s not just that I have never eaten a chip butty – the phrase has never passed my lips. I’m from the home counties, land of baps and sarnies; the word “butty” always makes me feel as if I’m cosplaying Noel Gallagher. When a teenage boyfriend took me to a Yorkshire chippy and a slice of buttered white appeared along with my order, I assumed it was in place of a bread basket.

‘It’s a three-note masterpiece of fat, salt and starch’ … Felicity’s debut butty. Photographs: Linda Nylind/The Guardian

I’ve had ample opportunity subsequently to correct this embarrassing deficit in my culinary education, but this particular carb-on-carb combination has never really appealed. I had my order down pat (cod in the north, haddock in the south, chips – salt, no vinegar, please – and mushy peas) and saw no reason to branch out.

Now, facing my fears in the service of serious journalism, I notice my local chip shop has a box of bread rolls on the counter. I ask for my butty wrapped, so it’s not until I get home that I realise the bread is crammed so full that it’s a bit-part player in this particular sandwich – chips are spilling out in every direction. I shove as many back in as possible and take a cautious bite.

00:28 Felicity Cloake tries a chip butty – video

The roll is soft, fluffy and saturated with salty melted butter, the chips deliciously dense and potatoey. It’s a three-note masterpiece of fat, salt and starch, gloriously simple and wonderfully comforting. Before I know it, I’ve eaten the lot. Maybe the real reason I avoided chip butties thus far was self-preservation, I reflect, crumpling up the grease-soaked paper. But there is no going back. It will still be a chip roll to me, though – you can only change so much in one lunchtime. Felicity Cloake

‘Two spoonfuls of trifle in, I feel bilious’

For a start, why do people say “a mere trifle”? There’s nothing mere about this layering of jelly, custard and cream. Trifle is the opposite of mere. It is conceptually, physically and digestively enormous.

Which leads me to my second question. How have I – an English person! – managed to avoid it for 40-odd years? Well, I don’t understand jelly, because I’m not four. Fruit compote is fine, but I’d rather have a banana. Custard is best treated like a naughty bowl of soup: served warm and eaten with a teaspoon in front of Gardener’s World, not as a substratum of a monster pud that dates back to the 16th century. Sponge fingers are just nifty conveyers of cream – and cream makes me volcanic.

Not a trifling matter … Chitra digs in. Photograph: courtesy of Chitra Ramaswamy

We get a strawberry one from an M&S garage, in accordance with the UK law that if one is eating trifle for the first time it must be an M&S trifle. Back home, I peel off the plastic wrapper and dig my spoon down into the mass. I’m looking for a little bit of everything, but my spoon emerges looking more like it’s just been in a fight with an Eton mess. Taste-wise, it’s all very soft, sweet and reminiscent of nursery days. In cheffy terms, there are textural issues and I’m not happy about the mouthfeel. Two spoonfuls in, I feel bilious. After three, the eruption begins to bubble up beneath my body’s crust. I’m too old for this crap.

I put the spoon down and watch my five-year-old – also eating trifle for the first time – mainline a giant wobbly bowl of the stuff. She gives it “twenteen out of twenteen”. Five minutes later, she is laughing maniacally and throwing all the cushions off the sofa. For the next two hours, she bounces off the walls while I belch. In conclusion? Never again.

‘Tomato Cup-a-Soup is a mysterious miracle powder’

Growing up, my house was a tomato-free zone. It was banished in all its forms, thanks to my dad’s deep hatred of its taste. No cherry tomatoes for salads, no giant beef variants for sandwiches, not even a sun-dried husk lingering in a jar. Bursting with seeds and filled with watery juice, tomatoes seemed so unappealing that I was happy to forgo them.

Thanks to pizza, pasta sauce and ketchup on chips, I worked tomatoes into my diet as I got older, but in soups they have always been strangely absent. So, sitting down to taste tomato soup for the first time, at 29, I decide that I need to get the full gamut of recipes in me. I am holding out for a revelation, to make up for lost time.

‘Sweet, tangy and slightly synthetic’ … Ammar’s verdict on Heinz. Photographs: Linda Nylind/The Guardian

First up: Heinz cream of tomato in a can. The everyman staple, the soup I imagine every household has lurking in the cupboard. It has a pleasingly smooth consistency when I dump it into the pan, but on the first try it tastes like a watered-down ketchup – sweet, tangy and slightly synthetic. No revelation yet.

Tesco’s Finest is next, promising a luxury experience thanks to its sun-dried tomatoes and the addition of lentils. Unfortunately, the former make the soup too sweet and the latter add strange fibrous lumps. It’s sauce without the pasta.

Finally, Cup-a-Soup, the sachet to which you add boiled water. My expectations are low; the powder smells musty when it goes into the cup. But it is surprisingly delicious. The grains dissolve to create a tomato soup that is lip-smackingly savoury. It doesn’t have the tang and texture of tomatoes, but I slurp the whole thing up anyway. It’s a mysterious miracle powder – one that might even be worth sneaking to my dad for a try. Ammar Kalia

‘Hard-boiled egg? I’d rather eat a fistful of cat litter’

For a hen-keeper, I’m funny about eggs. It’s the texture: whatever witchcraft happens when heat meets albumen spooks me. I only ate my first at 17, in the most palatable, un-eggy format (omelette). I have improved since, but barely. I can eat fried eggs if the yolk remains completely liquid – the slightest hint of solidity and I’m out. I place a protective spatula under yolks to stop them cooking. Shut up – that’s not weird.

I’m trying hard-boiled today because it’s the scariest of variants. I hate the smell and the naked, indecent look of them; they’re absolute wrong ’uns. For extra cruelty, my editor suggests I try that horrendous pub staple, the pickled egg, too. Great: if there is anything I hate more than the thought of a hard-boiled egg, it’s vinegar. I agree, though, because I’m spineless.

‘I manage one mouthful and give up’ … Emma tries to hold down a pickled egg. Photographs: courtesy of Emma Beddington

I eat only my hens’ eggs, for welfare reasons, so I have to pickle my own. Resentfully, I heat vinegar, sugar and various spices that will in no way make the whole outrage any more palatable, then pour it over the hard-boiled output of my beloved bantams. They go in a jar to fester – sorry, “mature”. Weirdly, this British depravity thrills my French husband. “Eggs and vinegar,” he keeps saying, happily. “What’s not to like?”

A few days later, it’s the moment of truth. First, my spouse hard-boils me a fresh egg and hands it over with obscene glee as I glare at him. I take a big bite: foul. The white is like biting into an eyeball (I imagine); the yolk is sulphurously wrong in every way and its fudgy texture disgusts me.

00:20 Emma Beddington tries a hard-boiled egg – video

It is, however, ambrosial compared with the pickled egg. The vinegary white has become dramatically rubbery. How? Why? The yolk is less vinegar-soaked, so marginally better. I’d rather eat a fistful of cat litter, though. I manage one mouthful and give up; my husband adds mayonnaise and polishes off the lot, eggstatically. For me, un oeuf is more than enough. Emma Beddington

‘Nothing could be less tempting than thick, pink tubes of saveloy’

Saveloys, those gleaming, sweaty red cylinders you see in the cabinet at the chip shop alongside the battered sausages and Pukka pies, have always filled me with a nameless dread. Their dyed flaming colour is jarring, as is their enigmatic name, suggesting something strange inside. What might that be? Blood, kidneys, spleen, hearts? Traditionally, it was pigs’ brains, but today, apparently, they merely contain ground-up pig and cow, along with vegetable matter and the eye-catching colourant.

But a challenge is a challenge, so I am in line at my local chippy to order saveloy – which, incidentally, is a hell of a lot cheaper than cod. Nothing could be less tempting than the five thick, pink tubes in the glass-fronted warm display area above the chip fryer. Its shelves are otherwise empty: towards the end of Saturday lunch, every other sausage and pie has sold. Only the unloved saveloys lie on top of each other, like shagging snakes. Then one is plucked out and plonked in a carton with my chips.

‘A good, if unexciting, sausage’ … Jonathan’s saveloy. Photograph: Sarah Currie

In the street, I tentatively open the polystyrene box and pick up the warmish block. The first bite is … OK, actually. No gristle. Not like a tinned frankfurter, then. It has a consistent, mild flavour and firm but yielding texture – a good, if unexciting, sausage. Suddenly, half is gone. I had genuinely expected it to be so vile that I had assembled a load of condiments at home to help get it down. But by the time I get there it is just a stub.

Someone should reimagine this venerable British street food. It’s not as outrageous as an andouillette, but it sure beats the average hotdog. I should have bought two. Jonathan Jones

‘Eating my first oyster, it’s as if my tonsils have come loose’

I’m no foodie, but I like to try new things and I’ve got a strong stomach. I’ve eaten haggis, crocodile, snails, some ambiguous meat stews. But one thing I’ve never been tempted to try is seafood. Because of its sheer strangeness, it seems unwise to consider it food at all – like eating creepy-crawlies from outer space.

I am especially revolted by oysters, attributable to an episode of Mr Bean that I watched repeatedly as a child, in which Bean gets food poisoning at a seaside B&B and has a fever dream of slurping green goo from shells.

The stuff of nightmares … Mr Bean’s run-in with an oyster.

Twenty years later, Mr Bean is less obviously someone to look to for life lessons – but, at 32, my taste is hardly more refined than it was at 12. Could gaining a taste for oysters help me feel more like a grownup? At The Bay seafood bar, at Jarrold’s department store in Norwich, I intend to find out.

Even in my ignorance, it’s clear that these are superior examples, glistening as though they have just been plucked from the sea. Indeed, I’m told they have come from Brancaster, on the north Norfolk coast, fresh this morning.

On their bed of ice, they look like works of art – but, though I am admiring them, I don’t want to eat them. They are also huge – the size of a cow’s tongue. I have no idea where to start.

‘I feel as if I have inhaled a mouthful of saltwater’ … Elle’s encounter with oysters. Photographs: courtesy of Elle Hunt

Sensing my nervousness, Helga from Jarrold’s instructs me to sling one to the back of my throat, without toppings in the first instance, then bite down. “You know on I’m a Celebrity, when they have to eat the eyeballs?”

I raise a shell to my nose then tip my head back, scrunching up my face like I’m about to jump into the sea. At once, I feel as if I have inhaled a mouthful of saltwater.

The only impression I get of the oyster is as a foreign body that I’ve unwittingly caught in my mouth. It’s as if my tonsils have come loose and are swilling around – something is forcing its way down my throat, or up it, but fighting me either way. After all, as Helga points out, these creatures are still alive.

I don’t retch, exactly, but I certainly fail to disguise that I find the experience deeply unpleasant. The second oyster is even bigger. This time, I drown it in red wine vinaigrette, but I end up with that all over my face as the creature clings on to its shell. I eventually succeed, but my unhappy expression makes clear the cost.

Helga is diplomatic: “At least you’ve tried them now.” The fishy, salty, shallotty aftertaste, which persists for hours, is a reminder: I had a new experience – and it was exactly as I had imagined. Elle Hunt

‘School shepherd’s pie had a diabolical pea-to-meat ratio’

Although my childhood fussiness has given way to a general inclination to stick anything in my gob, I have stoically refused to eat a shepherd’s pie. To some, it may represent a hot mess of homely delight, but to me it is a triumvirate of unpleasantness: peas, mash and British mediocrity. It epitomises our tendency to settle for less.

My cynicism stems from the institutional setting in which I first encountered it. My mum is not British, which meant the lovingly prepared meals I had at home weren’t, either. On Sunday, we had bolognese, steak bavette or Nigerian rice and stew. Shepherd’s pie came at school; it was soggy, overcooked and with a pea-to-meat ratio that can be described only as diabolical.

‘It wasn’t so much eaten as deleted’ … the pie proves a hit with Sasha. Photograph: courtesy of Sasha Mistlin

Sure, British food has been US sitcom fodder for decades, but to truly illustrate the horror of 00s UK school food, know that it took me until adulthood to appreciate fish and chips.

And so to the pie. I opted for a local greasy spoon – although finding a fitting location that did a shepherd’s pie was more of a challenge than anticipated. I got a lot of “no can do mate, but I do a beautiful lasagne”.

Eventually, a cafe obliged. For £8.35, I got a shepherd’s pie, a mountain of chips and peas, all served in a gravy soup. I have to admit, it looked delicious and reassuringly lasagne-like. Without hesitation, I tucked it.

It tasted so good. Or, at least, I think it did, because it wasn’t so much eaten as deleted. Immediately, I realised the error of my ways. Yes, lasagne and chips is the ultimate cafe combo – double-carb delight in an £8 package that you know is as offensive to Italian culture as Mario the plumber. But maybe – just maybe – the shepherd’s pie is an improvement on perfection. Sasha Mistlin

‘For such a subtle taste, taramasalata’s impact is spectacular’

I have spent years pretending not to like taramasalata, even though I have never tasted it. This felt like the surest way of never having someone attempt to get me to try it, the way people do when they find out you’ve never tried a divisive food: oysters, blue cheese, Angel Delight.

When I finally decide to face my fears, I go for something tried and tested – a big-name brand from a local deli. “Smooth and indulgent”, the packet promises. It certainly looks lovely, like a delicious strawberry milkshake. Which would be great, if it weren’t 8% fish roe. Apart from the “v Wade” kind, I am no fan of roe. That tapioca quality is fine when it’s in tapioca, less so fish eggs.

‘I can barely taste anything, but what I can taste I find to be revolting’ … Ellie reaches for an emergency pear. Photograph: courtesy of Ellie Violet Bramley

First, the smell. Subtly fishy is the best way to describe it. Although the unmistakable whiff of the sea is there, it isn’t the kind of seafood dish that knocks you round the nostrils like a lobster pot. I can’t pretend I am not a bit relieved.

I gamely put a big dollop on some flatbread – go hard or go home, I think – before thinking better of it and taking a delicate sample via a brief lick. The effect is immediate. For such an incredibly subtle taste, the impact is spectacular: pure, unadulterated disgust. I can barely taste anything, but what I can taste I find to be revolting. Then there is the texture, which is not, as I feared, like tapioca. It is much, much worse: inexplicably grainy.

I won’t go into details, but I will say there is some retching, some involuntary water streaming from my eyes, some emergency eating of a pear to try to rid my mouth of the memory. To mangle Macbeth, this pretty pot of taramasalata seems the innocent flower, but is very much the serpent under it.

None of this is taramasalata’s fault. It is my fault. But it is time for us to consciously uncouple nonetheless. I know I shouldn’t let this one run-in put me off all future encounters; I should try it at a Greek restaurant or make my own. But this is, without a doubt, the end of the road for me and taramasalata. Ellie Violet Bramley

‘Ribs sounded naff, meat cosplaying as masculinity’

It’s the name that has always put me off ribs. And the fact it’s mandatory to eat them with your hands. And because of the way the American ones, all sweet and red and sticky, have permeated British culture; they remind me of Keith Urban, stag nights and red pleather banquettes. Homer food, tough-guy food, except that you need wet wipes on standby, as if you are a baby.

It’s not because I don’t eat meat. I grew up on a smallholding and we ate what was previously walking around our field. As an adult, ribs just sounded a bit naff, meat cosplaying as masculinity, but I appreciate I’m a meat snob. Plus, I’m told they’re fun to eat in a carnal, Wolf Hall way.

‘The pork transcends the sweet, soy, salty sauce’ … Morwenna gets stuck in. Photograph: courtesy of Morwenna Ferrier

The question was which ribs to go for. There are plenty of excellent Turkish restaurants that do great lamb ribs near me. But the classic idea of ribs in the UK probably involves pork from the US or China. In a nod to the new cold war, I opt for China (sorry, Biden) and head to Yipin on Liverpool Road in Islington, north London.

Yipin specialises in food from Hunan province – its signature dish is called Chairman Mao’s pork; Mao’s childhood home also appears on the inside of the menu – but it also does classic Mandarin ribs.

Eight gleaming ribs arrive on an oval platter, a little too quickly, piled up like railways sleepers. The sauce is secret – of course it is – but the waitress mentions Worcestershire sauce. I try to eat them with chopsticks, but embarrass myself, so I use my hands.

The fatty, crisp-edged meat slips off the bone the moment I bite down. I hit a charred bit at the end, then a shred of connective cartilage so soft and rich you can bite through that, too. Suddenly, the pork transcends the sweet, soy, salty sauce. Ribs, it turns out, are about texture. Good ribs, anyway. You do, however, need to eat them with your hands, so that rules out a second run.

2023-03-24,2023-03-22 12:00:26,How to make Glamorgan sausages – recipe,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/22/how-to-make-glamorgan-sausages-recipe-felicity-cloake,Food,"The historic Welsh county of Glamorgan has long been famous for its sausages – and not just the cheesy ones. Described by one Victorian traveller as “not a whit inferior to those of Epping” (once also known as a sausage hotspot), the Glamorgan variety were originally made with pigs fattened on waste from the area’s equally well-known dairy industry. Though these cheese-based versions are a more recent creation, dating from the middle of the last century, I think they’re not a whit inferior to any meat-based example.

Prep 20 min

Cook 25 min

Makes 6

175g caerphilly, or vegetarian alternative (see step 1)

1 large leek (100g)

50g butter

Salt and pepper

Nutmeg, to taste

2 eggs

1½ tsp English mustard (see step 3)

2 tbsp milk

A few thyme stalks

170g fresh breadcrumbs, preferably a mixture of white and brown

50g flour

1 A word on the cheese

Both the Glamorgan cow, and the area’s once-thriving dairy industry, are now much reduced, and Glamorgan cheese has gone the way of so many other regional varieties. Happily, mild, crumbly caerphilly is said to be similar – but vegetarians beware: it’s often made with animal rennet, so substitute lancashire, Welsh cheddar or similar as required.

2 Chop, wash and fry the leek

Wash and finely slice the leek, taking care to rinse out any dirt and grit lurking between the layers.

Melt half the butter in a frying pan on a medium-low heat, then sweat the leeks, lightly seasoned with salt, pepper and nutmeg, until they collapse into soft ribbons, ensuring they don’t brown or crisp.

3 Mix the egg yolks, mustard and milk

Separate the eggs, setting the whites aside in a shallow dish for later. Beat the yolks with the mustard and milk – note that, though I prefer the fieriness of the English kind, any mustard will work here, though if you’re using a very mild example, you might want to add a pinch of cayenne pepper or similar as well. Crumble or coarsely grate the cheese, depending on its texture.

Strip off the leaves from the thyme sprigs, then finely chop them and put in a large bowl with 100g breadcrumbs (save the rest to coat the sausages later). Stir in the cheese and leeks, scraping the frying pan so you don’t lose any of their buttery juices, then add the egg yolk, milk and mustard mix to the bowl, too.

5 Finish the filling

Season the mixture lightly with more salt, pepper and nutmeg, then stir until you can see no more dry patches of breadcrumbs; the mix should just hold together when you try to shape a little into a ball. If it’s too dry, add a splash more milk; and if too wet, add a few more breadcrumbs.

6 Test, taste and shape

Melt a little more butter in the frying pan on a medium-high heat, pinch a small piece of the mixture into a ball and fry for a couple of minutes on each side, until golden. Taste and adjust the seasoning of the rest of the sausage mix, if necessary, then use damp hands to shape it into six plump sausages (more like croquettes).

7 Chill for at least an hour

Put the sausages on a plate and chill for at least half an hour, if possible (and for up to a couple of days, if you want to get ahead). You could cook them immediately, but they’ll hold together better if they’re good and cold. Once you’re ready to cook, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.

8 Flour, eggwash and crumb …

Put the flour on a small plate and the remaining breadcrumbs on a second plate. Whisk the egg whites in their shallow bowl, until frothy, then roll each sausage in turn in the flour, egg white and breadcrumbs to coat, shaking off any excess. (It’s always easier to do this with just one hand to keep the other clean.)

9 … fry gently, then bake

Melt the remaining butter in a frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, lay in the sausages and cook until lightly golden on one side, making sure the breadcrumbs are all coated in the melted butter. Turn to brown the other side.

Now transfer to a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, until richly golden. Serve immediately.

2023-03-24,2023-03-22 09:45:01,What’s The Difference Between Processed Foods And Ultra-Processed Foods?,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-are-ultra-processed-foods_l_64186cdce4b0cfde25c60853,Food,"Grace Cary via Getty Images Colorful breakfast cereal with milk fills spoon in foreground with cereal in glass bowl on pink background in out-of-focus background

You’ve likely heard health experts say that eating whole foods and skipping processed foods is a key to optimal health. A December 2022 study, for example, presented a pretty scary statistic linking ultra-processed foods to cognitive decline, saying that people who ate more than 20% of their daily calories from processed foods had a 28% faster decline in global cognition and a 25% faster decline in executive functioning, compared with people who ate less than 20%.

If you’re wondering what an “ultra-processed” food is, you’re not alone. It’s a complicated topic.

Most foods are at least minimally processed — usually for preservation or safety reasons — so completely staying away from all processed foods can be difficult, if not impossible. It’s also unnecessary.

“Processed food tends to get a negative reputation, but there are many minimally processed foods that are actually good for us,” Ashlee Wright, a registered dietitian at Orlando Health, told HuffPost. “If we think about foods, like baby carrots, nuts, chicken and fish, these have to be processed in some way, but they only have one ingredient.”

At the other end of the processed foods spectrum are ultra-processed foods, like frozen meals, doughnuts, cookies and candy. These typically contain dozens of ingredients, many of which you’ve never heard of and can’t pronounce. These are the items nutritionists suggest limiting.

Still, nutritionists acknowledge that understanding the difference between processed and ultra-processed foods is difficult. Here are some tips to help you sort them out.

Most foods are processed, at least somewhat

“Just about all food needs to be processed to eat it, so this can be so confusing,” said Colleen Tewksbury, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

The healthiness of processed foods usually comes down to other ingredients, like sugar or salt, that are added during processing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines processed foods as those that have undergone changes to their natural state. So, it’s any raw agricultural commodity that’s been milled, cut, chopped, cooked, frozen, dehydrated or canned.

“Many foods that people think of as whole foods technically are minimally processed, like frozen fruits or vegetables, or those bags of pre-cut veggies at the grocery store,” said Kristine Dilley, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

Processing techniques, like pasteurization, canning or dehydrating, also make foods safer to store and ensure they keep for longer periods of time, Dilley said.

Richard Clark via Getty Images Frozen vegetables are the perfect example of a type of ""processed"" food that's healthy.

How to understand the different kinds of processed foods

Not all processed foods are created equal. One way to explain the different levels of processed foods is the NOVA food classification system, developed by researchers at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The system has four categories:

Group 1: Unprocessed or minimally processed foods. This refers to fruits, vegetables, seeds, eggs, fungi or milk that are consumed in their natural state or altered to remove inedible or unwanted parts, like stems or shells. The foods might be dried, filtered, roasted, frozen or packaged to preserve their natural state, store them or make them more palatable.

Group 2: Processed culinary ingredients. These items are derived from Group 1 or nature, and include oils, butter, lard, sugar and salt. They’re usually used to prepare Group 1 foods and are rarely consumed on their own.

Group 3: Processed foods. These foods are produced by adding items, like salt, sugar, or oil (Group 2 items) to Group 1 foods. Examples include pickles, canned fish, cheese, canned fruits or vegetables, bacon or fresh bread. The foods usually retain their basic identity and some original characteristics.

Group 4: Ultra-processed foods. These items are created by industrial processes, like hydrogenation or adding emulsifiers, artificial colors, artificial flavors or preservatives. They include prepared meat, pasta or pizza; packaged bread, cookies or cakes; and soft drinks, candy, chicken nuggets or fast food. Ultra-processed foods tend to be highly palatable, inexpensive, convenient and contain multiple ingredients.

One issue with the NOVA system, Dilley said, is that it attempts to define the healthiness of foods in broad categories based on ingredients added during processing, which can be confusing for people. It also may inadvertently fuel the concept of “good” versus “bad” foods.

“This may be harmful to individuals who struggle with balanced eating or eating disorders, and may lead to an over-restrictive food intake,” Dilley said.

Should you limit ultra-processed foods?

Many ultra-processed foods are convenient and inexpensive, compared to some whole foods, so avoiding them is difficult for most people, Dilley said. Plus, there’s nothing wrong with enjoying sweets or soft drinks sometimes.

But the more processed the food, the more likely it is to contain extra calories, salt and sugar.

Research has linked consuming high amounts of ultra-processed foods to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and dementia. And the previously mentioned 2022 study has linked ultra-processed foods to cognitive decline.

If you’re eating processed foods, but are paying attention to the number of calories you’re consuming overall, some ultra-processed foods may not be worrisome, Tewksbury said.

Try sticking to the 80/20 rule, where you focus on eating unprocessed or minimally processed foods 80% of the time, Wright said.

“Give yourself some grace and realize that it can be challenging to avoid ultra-processed foods completely,” Wright said.

d3sign via Getty Images Even seemingly healthy foods, like orange juice, can contain unrecognizable preservatives and thickeners in their ingredient lists.

Which processed foods are the healthiest to eat?

“The simplest way to think about it is the fewer ingredients, the better,” Wright said. “If you start reading an ingredient list, and you can’t understand or even pronounce what’s in it, try not to eat it often.”

Choosing healthy foods can be confusing, especially when labels say things like “all-natural” or “made with whole grains,” but contain a host of other ingredients that make them ultra-processed, Wright added.

To make sure you’re opting for the least-processed options most of the time:

Look for items with five ingredients or fewer (or ones with the shortest ingredient list).

Note the first ingredient listed — that’s what the item contains the most of (look for bread listing “whole grain” first rather than “enriched flour,” for example).

Avoid (or minimize) products with added sugar, saturated fat and a high sodium content ( 20% or more of your daily value of sodium per serving is considered high).

Choose foods that are as close to their natural state as possible."
2023-03-24,2023-03-19 16:00:43,Handing down the family secrets – one dish at a time,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/mar/19/passing-on-the-family-secrets-one-dish-at-a-time-friends-recipes,Food,"There are two types of cooks in this world: those who keep their recipes secret, and those who share with joyful abandon. As someone who falls strongly into the latter camp, I am fascinated by the people who manage to maintain an air of mystery around their culinary creations. They breeze into a potluck supper with their signature dish, the one that everyone eagerly anticipates because nobody else knows how to make it. When a guest asks how the sauce is so wonderfully light, they simply answer with a smile.

I wonder what motivates some to divulge their recipes while others prefer not to. Perhaps it’s a difference in the idea of “ownership” – do recipes belong to anyone, can they be plagiarised, stolen even? Or are we merely stewards, just one stop in a recipe’s long trajectory? For those with closely guarded family recipes, they are more than just a set of instructions: they are inherited fragments of family history. Being part of a select club who know the key ingredient for Grandpa’s lasagne, or the exact proportions for Aunty’s biryani can even strengthen familial bonds. Recipes become an edible continuation of heritage.

For me, swapping favourite recipes – such as failsafe chocolate chip cookies, the perfect pilau, the easiest roast chicken – is the natural extension of the generosity shown in preparing and sharing food. Nevertheless, I sometimes panic when I am asked for the recipe for something I have made. I’m always flattered, of course – what could be a bigger compliment than someone else wanting to recreate my cooking for themselves?

My hesitation is because I cook intuitively, in the way that my mother taught me. I can never be sure exactly how I made something: I estimate quantities by eye, and I have never timed how long it takes for a sauce to reduce. As such, I fear being mistakenly assigned to that third (and worst) category of cook: the ones who give you the recipe, but leave out an essential ingredient or instruction, so it never quite tastes as good when you attempt to make it yourself.

I have a strong memory of watching my mother trying to master the art of making mishti doi, a Bengali dessert of baked sweet yoghurt. My father had tasted the dish at a family friend’s house and couldn’t stop talking about it, so my mother had begged the host for the recipe. But no matter how carefully she followed the instructions, it never tasted the same.

For about two or three months, Ammu would make a different attempt each weekend, but something was always missing. She would ask the friend to clarify measurements and cooking times, and the friend would give vague instructions. Eventually, Ammu worked out that the friend had left out a crucial instruction which was to place the earthenware bowl in a tray of water in the oven, to get the mixture to set. I still remember her sense of achievement when she finally nailed it and thinking how much nicer it would have been if that person had just shared the instructions fully to begin with.

There is a bigger question in all of this: what do we understand a recipe to be? At its most basic, it is a set of cooking instructions to convert certain ingredients into something edible. More elaborate recipes may contain additional information: practical guidance such as how to freeze or recommendations for substitutions; or some backstory regarding the provenance of the dish, its history or details of regional variations.

Recipes are recorded, shared and consulted in myriad ways: they can be codified, in the form of cookery books, a scribbled page torn from a notepad, or even a text message. They can be orally recounted, over the phone by a loved one living in a different country, or through a visual demonstration on a YouTube cooking channel or television programme. My own recipe collection reflects this eclectic way we gather these nuggets: a shelf full of beautifully styled cookery books, cuttings from magazines pinned to the fridge for so long the edges have curled, a folder full of screenshots from recipe blogs on my phone. Whatever their format, I stand by Nigella Lawson’s edict: “A recipe must be utterly reliable, but it is always an invitation, not a command.”

The emphasis on reliability is particularly important when considering the commercial aspect of cookery writing. When I entered the world of professional recipe writing, I had to test and measure diligently, noting timings and cooking temperatures in a way that I never did when cooking for myself. I always nervously awaited the feedback from the magazine test kitchens who would trial my recipes before publishing them, praying that they had worked.

The belief that reliability is attained by specificity is increasingly common. Flicking through a recipe book recently, I noted that exact quantities of herbs were given in grams, rather than the more general estimations of “a small bunch of mint” or “a handful of chopped coriander”. But the role of ingredients is not determined by measurements alone: tomatoes can be more or less ripe, garlic sweeter or stronger, chillies vary in heat. Does giving weights by the gram and timings to the minute account for the natural variation in flavours and preferences? Of course, this depends on how you like to cook. There are some who get frustrated by recipes that say things like “salt to taste”. There are others, like me, who will never weigh out 15g of coriander leaves, regardless of the recipe instruction.

We all use recipes differently. Some see them as laws to be followed to the letter, others view them as inspiration

There is also a question of philosophy: what purpose does one believe a recipe ought to serve? I was taught to cook by a mix of demonstration and oral instruction. The recipes I learned from my mother and aunts were recited and assumed a certain level of familiarity with the ingredients and methods: quantities were approximated, timings loosely described, such as “until the oil rises to the top”.

There is a word used across the Indian subcontinent for this: andaaz – loosely translated as estimation. The vagueness is not intended to be difficult; rather, it speaks to the different expectation in what a cooking instruction is supposed to do. In being imprecise and allowing room for variation, it allows a home cook to be able to improvise where needed. Your grandmother would hope you can figure it out even if you’re short an onion and only have green and not red chillies available.

We all use recipes differently. Some see them as laws to be followed to the letter, believing they have been tried, tested and presented as they are for a good reason: if the recipe creator recommends parsley, they meant parsley, and not a different herb. Others view recipes as inspiration; suggestions that appeal to our imaginations and palates, and can be adapted to suit what we have in the fridge. I was struck by a comment made by a friend who recently came out of a relationship. She and her ex-partner cooked very differently: she liked the structure and order; he was much more open to adapting. Perhaps the way we cook can be reflective of how we view life, she said.

We can often trace the course of our lives – who we met, where we lived, what we have done – through the recipes we collect along the way. I love the seemingly coincidental events that result in a recipe being acquired and becoming firmly embedded in one’s repertoire, like the carrot and white bean salad made by a classmate for an end-of-term dinner when I was at graduate school in Philadelphia, and which I still often make for parties.

The stories of different families can become enmeshed: I have a cranberry sauce recipe from a friend’s dad who saved it from Gourmet magazine in November 1985. It came to me complete with his own edits: “Use 1 pound (not 2!) frozen white pearl onions (Birds Eye) instead of all the fuss over the onions,” he advises. Last year, another friend emailed me a recipe for his Granny Esther’s meatballs: “I was lazy and used Google translate,” he explained – the recipe had come to him in Hebrew. Over time the same recipe has been conveyed orally, as well as written, in different scripts and languages, on paper and digitally: a living embodiment of one family’s history, as well as becoming a dish that now appears on my dining table too.

When I got married, some of my friends collected their tried and trusted recipes and wrote them into a book for me. I now make Ed’s baked lemon chicken with chickpeas and Natalie’s tuna coriander pasta with comforting regularity. When my flatmate and I finally parted ways after almost a decade, I gave her a handwritten collection of recipes that I cooked for us as twentysomethings living in London. The other day she sent me a photo: a bowl of white rice, tomato dal and sardine bortha – the Bangladeshi comfort food I used to make, which she now cooks for her own children. It is moving to think that my recipes are becoming part of another family’s story.

In our family we have two grandmothers’ recipe books. My nanu’s book, Rannar Boi, which literally translates to “cookery book”. It is a beautifully illustrated tome of traditional Bengali recipes written in the Bangla script. The front cover illustration depicts the ideal Bengali housewife, in a colourful sari, smiling as she scales fish using a da on the floor, with a large fridge-freezer in the background – the coveted blend of modernity and tradition. Inside, my grandmother’s name is written, then my mother’s and my aunt’s.

My husband inherited his grandma’s treasured The Complete International Jewish Cookbook by Evelyn Rose. Her neatly written notes in the margins offer improvements: “Allow to marinate in lemon juice and oil,” she recommends on a recipe for grilled salmon. For winter barbecued chicken, she advises that “sauce can be thickened with cornflour slaked with water”. This wisdom feels like a gift; we are benefiting from her experimentation decades later.

I have arrived at the idea that there are at least two people – often more – involved in any sharing of recipes: the one who gives it and the cook who follows it, and sometimes someone in-between to offer suggestions or improvements. It is a dance of sorts: one leads, the other follows. There is a necessary sequence, but there is room for flourishes, twirls, additional colour. That’s what makes it beautiful and different every time.

She also sat down with actor and Hideaway investor Ryan Phillippe to find out when his interests in restaurants started. (Hint, it was way before his Hollywood days).

The restaurant is inspired by the Baja region of Mexico, and it shows. Ryan wants you to walk away from this experience with more than just having had a good steak or seafood dinner.

A highlight: The “Push for Tequila” button.

Jessica also got to hang out in the kitchen and got to see how the chimichurri sauce is made (see recipe below).

This segment aired on California Cooking with Jessica Holmes, Episode 142.

Chimichurri Sauce Recipe, courtesy of The Hideaway

Ingredients

1/2 cup chopped flat leaf parsley

1/2 cup chopped cilantro

1 TBLS chopped fresh oregano

4 ea whole peeled garlic cloves

2 ea shallots small diced

1 ea jalapeno – deseeded small diced

2 ea chile fresno deseeded small diced

2 ea limes

2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil

1/2 cup red wine vinegar

2 TBLS kosher salt

1 TBLS fresh cracker black pepper

Instructions

Gather all ingredients, a medium size mixing bowl, micro plane, lime juicer, and a whisk. Measure everything and prepare all veggies and herbs. In a medium size bowl, use the micro plane to grate all 4 garlic cloves and the zest of one lime (make sure when you zest the lime you only use the green part – we don’t want to use any of the white part because it will make the Chimichurri bitter). Cut both limes in half and juice them right into the bowl with the garlic and lime zest. Also, add your vinegar, salt, and black pepper. Whisk in the extra virgin olive oil. Once you have all your liquids together, begin adding the rest of the ingredients – whisk them all together. Let them sit for about half an hour so all the flavors marinate together. Taste it and see if it needs more salt or black pepper."

In-person chemistries disappoint compared to the fiery connections felt in conversation. Someone fails to move on from a connection they made in the pods and flirts behind their partner’s back when they finally all unite at a resort in Mexico. People grapple with the hurtful knowledge that they were not their partner’s first pick. As a viewer, there’s a sense now that these relationships peak in the pods, before things get real; the emotional fireworks at that early stage are the show’s greatest strength, and I love watching people develop a strong rapport by talking alone. But so many things go downhill from there. One of the big twists Netflix teases in the trailer is that one of the singles realizes he proposed to the wrong person and decides midseason to propose to someone else, forcing her to choose whether to let him back into her life after he dumped her in the pods.

That curveball aside, the fact that many of the same tensions pop back up season after season reflects either a lack of creativity on the part of producers or, more likely, a fundamental problem with the parameters of the show. Love Is Blind holds singles in speed-dating jail for 10 days and then slingshots them onto the fast track to marriage. But there’s no way to judge whether you are compatible life partners during a 38-day shooting schedule that is completely detached from reality.

During the vacation in Mexico, Jackelina has an intense emotional breakdown; it’s not clear exactly what it is about. “I’m thinking about home. I’m thinking about my people. I’m thinking about work,” she says in her confessional. “A real commitment to me is loving my family even though my family ain’t perfect. And I’m scared that I’ll lose him, that I’ll push him away.” Sobbing, Jackelina locks herself behind a door in the hotel room and tells fiancé Marshall, “Home will always be into play for me. I think this place right now is just temporary.” Marshall assures her, as best he can, that he is there for her, but they are, ultimately, still people who have known each other for a little more than a week. Her inability to cope with this overwhelming experiment is arguably more relatable than his unflinching optimism, which is as kind as it is baseless."

It’s a drastic shift from the relatively lighthearted season premiere, as the mystery of what’s going on with Lois Lane is revealed in dramatic fashion: she’s not pregnant, and she’s not suffering from some fictional alien illness, but the all-too-real menace of breast cancer. The decision to undertake this storyline wasn’t one taken lightly by the cast or crew.

“We just felt like it’s such an important thing to discuss,” Superman & Lois co-showrunner Brent Fletcher tells me. “Lois Lane is such an iconic character, we feel like now that the audience knows this family, we can show the audience what this journey is really like. We built everything in service to that story…And very intentionally, there’s no magic cure. There’s no thing in the Fortress of Solitude that’s going to save Lois. This is a real cancer journey that many women are going through. We did a lot of research, we talked to survivors, women that are going through it, oncologists, the CDC. Our writers did a ton of work on this so that we could tell something that people would recognize and people can relate to and learn from.”

But before they put pen to paper, the showrunners went to star Elizabeth Tulloch to make sure she was on board.

“Todd and Brent made sure, to their great credit, that I was comfortable with this storyline,” Tulloch tells me. “They had pitched it to the studio and…then they called me and said… ‘we know, it’s incredibly intense, it’s going to be emotional, and how do you feel about this?’ I thought, What a cool idea to make one of the primary villains for season three be a villain that millions and millions of people around the world can relate to, or have been affected by themselves or someone that they love.

And not only that, but a villain that Superman can’t just easily take out. There’s no easy fix to this. It’s a very human problem that she’s having. It was a little bit daunting because the kind of breast cancer Lois gets is called inflammatory breast cancer, and it’s extremely aggressive. It’s not even detectable until it’s stage three. So it’s an advanced and aggressive kind of breast cancer. I was excited. It was a challenge, like I knew it would be. And I was also pleased that they they felt that they trusted me enough with something this serious.”"

The producer, who has worked with Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki Minaj, is notably the first and only woman to debut at No. 1 on Billboard‘s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs as a producer this century. Listen here.

“I like to work with talented people and it’s never really been part of my process to consider gender when choosing collaborators but I think it’s important to work on closing this gender gap we all feel is still an obstacle,” Twain explained in a statement. “So in this instance, I sought out a female remixer – I liked Malibu Babie’s style and knew she was a fan from her TikTok mashup of one of my songs. I think her ‘Giddy Up! Remix’ is awesome, she is so talented and I’m so pleased to give a fellow female producer the spotlight. I hope the fans love it as much as me!”

The original version of “Giddy Up!” appears on Twain’s latest LP, Queen of Me. The album also features singles “Waking Up Dreaming” and “Last Day of Summer,” and track “The Hardest Stone,” produced by Twenty One Pilots’ Tyler Joseph.

Earlier this month, Twain released her Spotify Singles session, accompanied by a cover of Harry Styles’ Fine Line song “Falling.” Last year, Styles performed two of Twain’s songs at Coachella, and welcomed the country singer on stage to deliver her Nineties hits “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” and “You’re Still the One” together.

Twain will be touring in North America this spring and summer in support of Queen of Me. The headlining run kicks off April 28 in Spokane and continues through July. After a string of dates in the U.K. in September she will return to the road in the U.S. until mid-November."

One of Hollywood’s most talented and revered actors is Christian Bale. He created a respectable reputation with the movies he performed in and the stories and characters he brought to life for us. He takes the audience on an incredible journey and a rollercoaster of emotions with his acting. For that, he won numerous awards and achievements through his dedication to the characters he plays. When we say dedication of this guy, we mean it. As a chameleon, he changes himself for the roles, often including body transformation.

The Lengths Christian Bale Goes for His Roles

Christian is widely recognized as one of the physically dominant artists of his time. Once he commits to a role or project, he gives everything he has to it. The actor has truly done it all: he has gained weight, lost it all, shaved his head and eyebrows, built muscle, and even developed a hunch that caused a herniated disc. Nobody can deny that Bale loves his characters and his craft with all of his heart. And he has done this so many times that we felt the need to praise him with this article. Let’s look at what he went through for the movies he played in.

The Machinist

A deeply unsettling and scary physical transformation was done by the actor for a magnificent role in this movie. Probably the most shocking of all time. If you want to check some shockingly good social casinos, visit Gamblingguy.com. Going through the diet that went on for months, and eating a meal that included water, coffee, apple, and whiskey allowed him to transition from 183 pounds down to only 120! The crazy guy wanted to go even further but the producers didn’t allow it. They thought of his health more than he did.

Vice

The role of vice president Dick Cheney under George W. Bush for eight years was something that Christian Bale couldn’t miss out on. As a modest guy, who doesn’t even consider himself a movie star (luckily we do), he had to go into the role of a man who wanted to be the president of the United States. To better bring this character to us, he bulked up with 40 pounds of fat. He was so dedicated to creating himself big that he ate specific food which would fatten his neck, and bleached his eyebrows so he could look more like Cheney.

The Fighter

To better bring out the role of Dicky Eklund, a former boxer who was a drug addict, Bale had to lose weight again. He lost 45 pounds to look more like the troubled person he was trying to represent. But not just that, he thinned his hair and changed his accent. All that was tiresome for the man, but not without its rewards. The movie itself won numerous awards, and Bale won the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Certainly, something of which he can be proud, and what gave him that feeling that all that transformation was not in vain.

American Psycho

The role of a serial killer and an ego-manic Patrick Bateman, and the movie itself are phenomenal. But to better represent him, he needed to go through a series of training to show us the amazing physics of the character. He went under excruciating exercises for months and often tanned his skin. As that was not enough, he capped his teeth and ate only protein food. As a completely narcissistic and superficial character, his looks needed to be perfect, for the audience to perceive him appropriately. Bale managed in doing exactly that.

Conclusion

These are only some of the roles of the great actor and a true star in the movie industry as Christian Bale surely is. We would need a lot more space to mention the roles from Batman, American Hustle, Ford v Ferrari, Rescue Dawn, Amsterdam, or his Marvel debut – the role of the villain, Gorr the God Butcher from Thor: Love and Thunder. Every single of these roles is challenging in many ways, and since the audience responds so well to visual experience, Bale managed to bring his characters even closer with his body transformation. We hope that he will entertain us in many years that come."
2023-03-24,2023-03-24 06:42:00,Zendaya Thanks Euphoria Co-Star’s Performance In The Last Of Us,https://markmeets.com/entertainment/zendaya-thanks-euphoria-co-stars-performance-in-the-last-of-us/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=zendaya-thanks-euphoria-co-stars-performance-in-the-last-of-us,Entertainment,"Zendaya shouts out her Euphoria co-star Storm Reid’s outstanding performance in The Last of Us episode 7. Titled “Left Behind,” the flashback episode saw Ellie’s best friend Riley (Reid) return to the Boston Quarantine Zone and take Ellie out to an abandoned mall for one last night of fun before she deploys to Atlanta. Unfortunately, their night is devastatingly cut short by an infected, leaving both girls bloodied and bit.

Zendaya took to social media, calling out Reid’s performance in The Last of Us. With a simple heart, Zendaya praises the critically-lauded work Reid put into her episode of The Last of Us. Check out what she shared below:

Why Riley Was Vital For Ellie’s Journey in The Last of Us

Based on the original The Last of Us video game’s additional story content of the same name, “Left Behind” tells the origin of Ellie’s bite mark. The revelation of her immunity is the impetus for the Firefly’s new mission and Joel’s employment as a smuggler by the revolutionary faction. More importantly, it sets up a key character motivation for Ellie through a painful loss.

Prior to the events of “Left Behind,” Ellie and Riley developed a strong friendship while at school within the Boston Quarantine Zone. However, after Riley returned following an abrupt six-week absence, Ellie expressed her romantic interest in Riley, capping the night off with a kiss. The promise of a brighter future with Riley was taken away from her with the bite of an infected. The two decide to ride out the infection together, where Riley’s fate is left ambiguous.

That fateful night proved to be a major coming-of-age moment for Ellie with her first kiss, first love, and first kill. Ellie’s trauma through loss fueled her desire to use her blood to find a cure for the Cordyceps fungal infection plaguing the world. Ellie’s drive was clearly evident in The Last of Us as she fought alongside Joel throughout their perilous journey to keep going in hopes that no one else will ever have to suffer the same fate as Riley.

The EP marks the first time the couple has released music together, though they’ve both had production and songwriting credits on each other’s work in the past. But here, they trade vocals and lyrics, outlining the ins and outs of their relationship. The video for “Beso,” the lead single from the project, is one of the most personal glimpses into their romance they’ve shared. The heartwarming visual is comprised of short clips that show the two of them waking up in bed together, traveling to different cities, and hanging out backstage.

The most surprising scene comes in the last few seconds of the video: The music fades out and the camera focuses on a tearful Rosalia, who whispers, “Oh my God.” She shows a gigantic diamond ring on her left finger — one that some fans noticed in some of her Instagram photos back in July — and then kisses Rauw, telling him “I love you.”

The EP also includes the nocturnal, bass-heavy cut “Vampiros” and the bolero-influenced ballad “Promesa.” On the latter track, they sing about keeping the promises they’ve made to each other: “If you asked, I would swear to you again, like a pearl that returned to the bottom of the sea,” Rosalia sings.



In his 2021 cover story, Rauw called Rosalia “a GOAT” and raved about her music and production abilities. “She’s innovative. She’s creating new sounds,” he said."
2023-03-26,2023-03-26 10:09:00,Why Michelle Rodriguez Doesn’t Really Do Her Own Stunts Anymore,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/michelle-rodriguez-not-really-stunts-anymore.html/,Entertainment,"Actor Michelle Rodriguez is a Hollywood mainstay. She’s been a movie star for over 20 years and appeared in several hit franchises. That includes roles in the Fast & Furious films and 2009’s Avatar. But despite her many action movies, Rodriguez recently shared why she no longer does most of her stunts.

Michelle Rodriguez has done many action movies

Rodriguez demonstrated a knack for on-screen physicality upon her feature film debut. In 2000, she starred in director Karyn Kusama’s Girlfight as a young woman trying to make it in the male-dominated boxing world.

The following year, the actor landed her signature role as Letty Ortiz in the 2001 surprise smash The Fast and the Furious. But in addition to her continuing role in that franchise, Rodriguez has appeared in many other action hits. They include 2002’s Resident Evil, 2003’s S.W.A.T., and 2010’s Machete.

While she’s also maintained a consistent presence in horror films and thrillers — such as 2018’s woefully underseen Widows — Rodriguez has been open about her affinity for action.

Michelle Rodriguez admits she doesn’t do many stunts now

Rodriguez recently joined her Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves co-stars Hugh Grant and Chris Pine for a Wired Autocomplete Interview.

During the conversation, the question arose about whether Rodriguez does her own stunts. The actor had plenty to say about the subject.

“Only when they let me. I’m not as lucky as Tom Cruise or Jackie Chan. The insurance throughout the years has become a lot more responsible, and as it’s become more responsible, they’ve allowed me to do a lot less,” she explained. “So I don’t drive cars anymore. I just pull them in. I don’t do extraordinary fight sequences. I just land or do the drop … I’ve really loved everything I’ve done, and I trained really hard for it, with all the guns and the fighting choreography.”

She also described the “wild stuff” that happened on the set of 2002’s Resident Evil due to Germany’s gun rules. And Rodriguez reminisced about “almost [taking] people’s heads off in S.W.A.T.”

Clearly, it’s an element of the business the actor misses from her early years in movies.

The actor returns to her most iconic role in 2023

Michelle Rodriguez’s mention of no longer driving cars stings the most for the actor and her fans. After all, she has appeared throughout the Fast & Furious franchise as its de facto female lead. So the fact that she doesn’t get to do as much of the movies’ stunt work likely saps some of the fun from performing that role.

In any case, Rodriguez returns with Vin Diesel and the rest of the Fast family in the latest installment. Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) directs Fast X, the tenth and penultimate entry in the franchise.

With actors like Brie Larson and Jason Momoa joining the cast, the movie will reportedly key up the big finale in the yet-untitled 11th Fast & Furious film. Fast X hits theaters on May 19, 2023."
2023-03-26,2023-03-26 10:03:48,‘Down to the wire’: Martha Reeves faces funding deadline for Hollywood Walk of Fame star,http://rssfeeds.freep.com/~/732780743/0/freep/entertainment~Down-to-the-wire-Martha-Reeves-faces-funding-deadline-for-Hollywood-Walk-of-Fame-star/,Entertainment,"When Martha Reeves was selected in 2021 for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, her journey to one of the most famous destinations in showbiz was actually just beginning.

That June, the Detroit-raised Motown singer was thrilled to learn she’d been picked for the Walk of Fame, joining the array of celebrities whose stars line the gilded sidewalks of Hollywood and Vine. Having been nominated by a former manager, Reeves was greenlighted by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which oversees the popular tourist landmark.

Unbeknownst to much of the public, those iconic sidewalk stars come with a price tag — $55,000 is the going figure — to cover installation and other costs. For some recipients, the fee is covered by a related movie studio, record label or generous friend. But honorees often must launch fundraising efforts, private and public, just as Motown’s Funk Brothers did to secure their star in 2013.

Reeves, 81, said she was assured by the former manager that funding for the star was handled. She was confident her Hollywood ceremony would take place the following year, telling the Free Press in 2021: “My wildest dreams are coming true.”

But that turned out not to be the case — and now the clock is ticking. If Reeves’ star isn’t funded by June, her two-year nomination window will expire.

And so her new manager has launched a public fundraising campaign, hoping to secure $55,000 by June and seal Reeves’ slot on the 2024 Walk of Fame calendar. Fans can donate by credit card or check, and details are available at the recently launched MarthaReeves.net.

“Martha’s former representation got in over their heads on this,” said Chris Roe, a veteran Los Angeles talent agent who signed on last summer as Reeves’ manager. “They didn’t realize how hard it would be and wasted a year of fundraising time. Now we’re down to the wire.”

Along with the crowdfunding campaign, Roe said he’s working with private benefactors and corporations to hit the $55,000 mark. If the effort is successful, donors’ names will be listed in an official printed program at the Walk of Fame ceremony. (Contributors may also request anonymity.)

Once a Walk of Fame ceremony is scheduled, Roe said, he would then solicit another round of money — upwards of $25,000 — to fund Reeves’ Hollywood reception. Roe has held Hollywood Walk of Fame fundraising campaigns for two other clients, actor Malcom McDowell (2012) and late filmmaker George A. Romero (2017).

“It doesn’t take much to make a huge impact,” he said. “Doing without three or four Starbucks coffees for a week is a pretty nice contribution. A donation of $25 goes a long way.”

The Hollywood Walk of Fame campaign comes as Reeves marks her 60th anniversary with Motown.

In 1963, the label issued the first two albums by Martha and the Vandellas — “Come and Get These Memories” and “Heat Wave” — when the trio began a run of hits that endure as Detroit music staples: “Heat Wave,” “Quicksand,” “Dancing in the Street,” “Nowhere to Run,” “Jimmy Mack,” among others.

A limited-edition art print marking the group’s 60th anniversary is available for $100, with all proceeds earmarked for the Walk of Fame effort.

Some of those prints will be available at an upcoming listening party hosted by Reeves, who will revisit the pair of 1963 albums. The event will run from noon to 2 p.m. April 15 at Dearborn Music, 22501 Michigan Ave. in Dearborn.

If the Hollywood Walk of Fame fundraising succeeds, Reeves will become the latest Motown luminary with a sidewalk star, part of a roll call that includes Diana Ross (1982), Smokey Robinson (1983), Michael Jackson (1984), Marvin Gaye (1990), Stevie Wonder (1994), the Temptations (1994), Four Tops (1997) and label founder Berry Gordy (1996). In November 2019, near a cluster of Motown sidewalk stars at Sunset Boulevard and Argyle Avenue, Gordy was on hand as Hollywood officials christened the corner “Berry Gordy Square.”

Reeves' manager said he is determined to hit the $55,000 mark and secure her spot among fellow Motown stars.

“This honor bestowed upon Martha has meant a lot,"" Roe said. ""That star is there for generations to come, and Motown will always be stitched into the fabric of our society. So it’s a great accomplishment, Martha is very deserving, and I’m happy to take her across the finish line.”

Donation information is available at MarthaReeves.net.

TL;DR:

Prince William appeared “openly smitten” with a child at a 2022 St. Patrick’s Day event, according to a body language expert.

Prince William’s upper lip “give-away” suggested “male broodiness” or a desire for more kids, making baby no. 4 for him and Kate Middleton.

Kate Middleton’s body language signaled a “keen” desire to “start mothering.”

Prince William’s known to tease Kate Middleton about having more kids. Although the Princess of Wales isn’t alone in her “broodiness.” According to a body language expert, being around small children has “triggered” the Prince of Wales’ “parental emotions.”

Prince William looked ‘smitten’ with kids in hinting at ‘parental emotions’ for baby no. 4

William — and Kate — showed signs of wanting more kids on St. Patrick’s Day 2022, per body language expert Judi James.

“William was complaining his wife was getting broody a few days ago,” she said (via Express). However, as James explained, William’s body language pointed to a desire for baby no. 4.

“It’s not just Kate wearing signals of being besotted and broody when gazing at small babies and toddlers,” James said. “If Kate really is keen on a baby Cambridge number four,” she continued, “she might like to study her husband’s facial expressions as he gazes at a small baby in some of these poses, too.”

William “might like to act alarmed at the idea of another child but he looks adorably and openly smitten here,” James said. “His eye expression is softened. But it’s his upper lip as he smiles that is the give-away to what might be some male broodiness.”

Additionally, William’s “head tilt” coupled with a “small display of upper teeth, and the wave-shape of that upper lip with some distinct muscle puckering at one side, all suggest his parental emotions might have been triggered here too.”

Kate Middleton used a go-to ‘mothering’ move seen with George, Charlotte, and Louis

While William’s body language suggested another kid might not be such an outlandish idea, so did Kate’s. “Everything about Kate” suggested an eagerness to “start mothering the little girl who was presenting her with her flowers,” James said.

“Even when she is standing straight, her hands are held in a pose of anticipation, as though just waiting get off the blocks, push the coat into a ‘V’ at the front, and bend to give the little girl some undivided attention and communication,” she added.

Not only did Kate touch the girl’s hair but she also bent low in a move she does with Prince George, 9, Princess Charlotte, 7, and Prince Louis, 4. The mother of three also offered “smiling reassurance and support” as the girl tried on a guardsman’s hat.

William and Kate have been a family of five since welcoming Louis in April 2018. However, an “insider” told Us Weekly in late 2019 that Kate wanted more kids. She’d “love to have one more child,” they said. Although for William, “three children is more than enough.”

The source went on, claiming that “having four children was always part of Kate’s plan,” adding that although “it took a while” the pair got “on the same page” about baby no. 4.

“Kate’s desires to have another child have inspired him,” they said. “And, at the end of the day, he loves and appreciates the secure family setting he never had growing up. Why not make it bigger?”

She also did the voice for the game show “Supermarket Sweep.” Jennie McAlpine has a lot of skills and is also an entrepreneur. Annies are the name of the restaurant she owns in Manchester. It serves food from Britain.

Back to Jennie McAlpine’s pregnancy, it has been the most talked-about thing on the internet for the past few months.

The actress also said that the four of them are “over the moon” about growing their family this year. Jennie also said, “The best Christmas present was the thought of adding to our family’s mix and chaos.” When she and Chris found out she was pregnant, they were on a camping trip with their two kids. It was a great time. How? She felt sick, so she took a pregnancy test, which showed that she was pregnant.

2023-03-26,2023-03-26 05:05:00,Skittles May Be Banned in California if New Bill Passes,https://comicbook.com/irl/news/skittles-banned-new-california-bill/,Entertainment,"Skittles could be on the way out in one of the country's biggest states. A new bill introduced in the state of California is looking to ban a group of ingredients found in both Skittles and a whole host of other candies. When it comes to Skittles, the bill is looking to ban titanium dioxide, an ingredient added to the candies to help create a smooth texture. It also happens to be a compound banned by the European Union for its link to an increased risk of cancer.

In addition to titanium oxide, the four other ingredients included in bill AB 418 are Red Dye No. 3 (Erythrosine), potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil, and propyl paraben. Red Dye No. 3 can be found in many other candies including PEZ, Hot Tamales, and Dubble Bubble Gum. Citrus soft drinks are the biggest food product with brominated vegetable oil as an ingredient while titanium oxide can also be found in Nerds and other various gummy products.

The bill was introduced by Jesse Gabriel and if passed, California would be the first state in the country to ban the ingredients. ""Californians shouldn't have to worry that the food they buy in their neighborhood grocery store might be full of dangerous additives or toxic chemicals,"" Gabriel said in a statement first announcing the bill. ""This bill will correct for a concerning lack of federal oversight and help protect our kids, public health, and the safety of our food supply.""

Gabriel chairs California's Assembly Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection, which is working in part with the Environmental Working Group on passing the bill through state legislature.

""Why are these toxic chemicals in our food?"" EWG Governmental Affairs Senior Advocate Susan Little added in the statement. ""We know they are harmful and that children are likely eating more of these chemicals than adults. It makes no sense that the same products food manufacturers sell in California are sold in the EU but without these toxic chemicals. We thank Assemblymember Gabriel's efforts to remove these toxic additives from California's food supply.""

While the language of the bill would technically ban Skittles and many other candies from sale in California in their current form, the assemblyman said in a recent interview with NBC that he hopes the companies that produce the products will be willing to find a way to alter the recipes.

""There is no realistic chance that this bill will result in Skittles or any other product being pulled off the shelf and that is absolutely not the intent,"" Gabriel told the network. ""The idea here is for these companies to make minor modifications to their recipes so that these products don't include dangerous and toxic chemicals."""

Paul Heyman certainly feels that way, as he's acknowledging The Bloodline as not one of the best factions, but the best faction in WWE history. In fact, he's not stopping at WWE either, as in his latest post he describes the faction that Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and Heyman are a part of as the greatest faction in the history of pro wrestling and sports entertainment, and he spotlights just how long he's been helping the Anoa'i and Fatu families dominate for quite some time.

On Instagram Heyman wrote, ""We are officially one week away from @WWE #WrestleMania, where the Showcase of the Immortals this year will ACKNOWLEDGE the fact the #Bloodline is the #GOAT faction in the history of pro wrestling and sports entertainment 🐐⁠☝🏻🐐

With this year's WrestleMania ⁠centering around the longest reigning heavyweight champion in almost 40 years @romanreigns defending his Undisputed championship against @americannightmarecody, and the longest reigning tag team champions of all time @uceyjucey @jonathanfatu here defending their titles against #KevinOwens and @samizayn, it is with great honor that I call to your attention the fact I have been leading great warriors of the Anoa'i and Fatu family to victory for decades.

Here's @samuanoai & @rikishi aka The Samoan Swat Team (and later, The Headshrinkers) in 1989, when I led this magnificent duo to victory over The Road Warriors at the Omni in Atlanta, during a time when NOBODY beat The Road Warriors in the Omni!

Being the Wiseman for YOUR #TribalChief, the #Usos and @solosikoa, both on camera and behind the scenes, is the role of a lifetime, and it's been an honor for which I have been groomed, prepped and trained my entire life.

With this bond, we are unbeatable. With this history, we are united in the belief that we are permanent residents on the Island of Relevancy. With this love, respect and admiration for each other, we walk into WrestleMania defending the legacy of all those who paved the way for us to cherish every moment in the brightest spotlight ever earned by a faction in history. And it is with that same love, respect and admiration that we set the example for the future generations to follow and indeed surpass.

I offer to you, in all candor, something that every member of the WWE locker room has come to accept, and we will all be sure to reinforce next weekend at WrestleMania. It's simple. It's catchy. And it's a fact. #WeTheOnes☝🏻""

Every member of The Bloodline will be involved at WrestleMania 39, with Reigns defending his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Cody Rhodes and The Usos defending their Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championships against the reunited Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn. Solo doesn't have a match listed on the card just yet, but he will likely prove to be a major factor in either or both of those match-ups, and could end up taking on someone on his own before all is said and done."

Pokemon: Aim to Be a Pokemon Master was a special final season of the Pokemon anime meant to be Ash's final adventure after becoming the World Champion. But as Ash discovered more about himself and the world, he also comes to realize that being a Pokemon Master is a lot more of a challenge than he first expected.

The Pokemon anime began with Ash setting out on his journey to become the best that ever was on his road to being a Pokemon Master, and now that the anime has said its goodbye, Ash has actually taken the time to reflect on his journey overall. After a reunion with his longest rival, Gary Oak, Ash starts to question whether or not he's actually closer to being a Pokemon Master after winning the World Coronation Series. As he considers all of his travels, he comes to the answer that he's not quite a master just yet.

(Photo: The Pokemon Company)

Pokemon: Is Ash a Pokemon Master?

Pokemon: Aim to Be a Pokemon Master Episode 11 (serving as Ash's final episode in the Pokemon anime overall) sees Ash explaining to Pikachu that he doesn't feel like a Pokemon Master, ""Back then, [Gary] asked me how closer I was to being a Pokemon Master, but being Champion's not my goal. I still consider myself a challenger. I wanna have lots more adventures, and meet more Pokemon. All the things that happen each day...Every one of them matters...""

As for what Ash believes being a Pokemon Master means, he's likely still very far from that end goal, ""I wanna make friends with all the Pokemon in the world. That's gotta be what it means to be a Pokemon Master."" The goal to make as many friends as possible was Ash's final goal for the anime's special finale series overall, so this final realization helps it all to cement Ash's journey through the Pokemon anime for all this time.

But while Ash might not feel like he's a Pokemon Master, fans will disagree! Do you think Ash has become a Pokemon Master now that he's leaving the anime? Let us know all of your thoughts about it in the comments! You can even reach out to me directly about all things animation and other cool stuff @Valdezology on Twitter!"

Video game adaptations are a very controversial topic. For the longest time, they were truly awful with a few mildly good ones to offset it all. However, in recent years the sentiment has changed as Hollywood appears to have cracked the code. The Last of Us is generating award buzz, movies like Sonic the Hedgehog are met with enthusiasm, and more and more gaming adaptations are getting greenlit with major talents backing them. One such project is Ghost of Tsushima with John Wick director Chad Stahelski. The director has risen in prominence in recent years for his expert handling of the John Wick franchise, showing he can blend amazing action with meaningful storytelling.

However, Ghost of Tsushima is a very specific kind of game, it has a distinct look and visceral action. Director Chad Stahelski has noted that he is aware of how important the visuals are in the game and wants to find a way to sustain that in his film, but he also noted in an interview with IGN that he isn't ruling out a black and white version. Despite the game being extremely colorful, there is a ""Kurosawa mode"", which makes the game look more like a black and white Akira Kurosawa film. Fans loved this touch and Stahelski noted that it's ""definitely a conversation"". Of course, this could just mean they do a black and white cut of the film for the home video release or it could mean select sequences are presented in black and white.

It remains to be seen how the movie will be handled. It sounds like the movie is still a ways away from actually releasing as there is no casting news and it's unclear if the script has been finalized. Stahelski is attached to a number of major movies, so it's unclear what's actually next on his agenda.

Do you want to see a black and white version of the Ghost of Tsushima movie? Let me know in the comments or hit me up on Twitter @Cade_Onder."

From her social media posts about the power of self-love to her songs about growing stronger after a tough breakup, Gomez has earned fans thanks to her transparent, open personality. One of Gomez’s most intensely personal projects was her 2022 documentary, My Mind & Me. In the documentary, the star gave fans an inside look at her mental health, including her bipolar disorder. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Gomez discussed how she appreciates how differently fans treat her in the wake of My Mind & Me.

What was the Selena Gomez documentary ‘My Mind & Me’ about?

For years, Gomez was seen primarily as a teen icon, a young woman who rose to fame on the Disney Channel before embarking on a hugely successful career in music. Her high-profile relationship with Justin Bieber helped to keep her name in the headlines. However, as Gomez has grown and matured, she has worked hard to shine a light on the importance of mental health awareness. Gomez has used her own bipolar disorder as an example. And in late 2022, she released a brand-new documentary called My Mind & Me.

The documentary spans many years of Gomez’s life, detailing both her mental and physical health journey. It even touches on the star’s battle with lupus and her time in treatment, which made headlines around the world. Raw and intensely personal, the documentary was a revelation for Gomez’s fans who had no idea about the depth of her struggles with mental health.

In a 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, Gomez touched on how the release of the documentary changed her life. Specifically, the way that fans approach her in the street. She admitted that she’s glad that fans now see her with some dimension. “That was happening more, and I started to feel good because I wasn’t just this prop to people — like, ‘You’re so cute. Let’s take a picture.’ It was more than that. It was a conversation about mental health or courage or disappointment or loss. And I started to go, ‘This is paying off,’ because that’s what I want at the end of the day. I’d rather be remembered for my heart than anything else.”

Gomez also discussed how scared she was prior to the release of My Mind & Me. “I was terrified. But after the documentary came out, I started noticing people come up to me, and they weren’t like, ‘Oh, I want a picture of you.’ It was more like, ‘Hey, I appreciated that part where you said this,'” Gomez said. “Then I ended up having a five-minute conversation with someone about their journey.”

Selena Gomez has been open about her bipolar disorder

Gomez told Vanity Fair that, in many ways, the release of My Mind & Me has been “freeing” for her. “I’m just so used to censoring myself that it was a, me wanting to let go and b, if they’re telling me to be quiet about it, that’s not good because that’s genuinely not the place I’m in anymore,” she said. “I’m not ashamed of it. I don’t ever feel, even for five seconds, that I’m crazy. My thoughts tend to ruminate, but it’s up to me to be proud of who I am and to take care of myself.” These days, Gomez is one of the strongest celebrity advocates for mental health awareness and understanding."

First after the rhythm dance, Chock and Bates finished first in the free dance at Saitama Super Arena with 134.07 points for a total of 226.1.

Reigning European champions Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri of Italy were second with 219.85 points while Grand Prix Final Champions Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada were third with 217.88.

“We’ve been pursuing this goal for so many years,” Bates said. “It was exciting and stressful all at the same time. I know that the ice dance field is so competitive. We’ve competed against all these teams for so many years. We really just wanted to focus on ourselves and skate our best.”

Chock and Bates, the three-time Four Continents champions , have been together for 12 years.

They won the silver medal at the 2015 world championships in Beijing, bronze in Boston in 2016 and bronze last year in Montpellier, France.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 22:56:36,Obsessive Fans Are The Ones Behind The Supposed Feud Between Selena Gomez And Hailey Bieber,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/selena-gomez-hailey-bieber-feud-fan-created,Environment,"Hailey posted a video last April begging people to stop. “Enough time has gone by where it’s valid to leave me alone,” Hailey said. “I beg of you, truly, that’s my only request. Leave me alone.” Sadly, the audio of Hailey pleading went on to become a trending sound used by 23,000 people .

Then, in September, Hailey clarified again that she had no beef with Selena. “I respect her, there’s no drama personally,” she said. Shortly afterward, Selena called the harassment of people online — not specifying Hailey, but again fans assumed — “just vile and disgusting” and “not fair.”

Things got so chaotic the pair posed for a photo together last November, finally smiling proof that there was no feud.

But that didn’t stop fan accounts. Dedicated to either Selena , Jelena , or Hailey , they have continued to shape the conversation by claiming posts by Selena and Hailey are constantly shading each other.

Fans are continually obsessed with the idea that the two are copying each other. For example, Selena posted a photo of herself beaming at the camera, while wearing a yellow top with green flowers, on what appears to be kindergarten picture day. Days later, Hailey posted a throwback photo of herself at a similar age, looking up at the camera pouting while sporting blunt bangs. Immediately, hundreds of compilation videos declared it a copycat move.

One TikTok post with 16 million views, titled “ Proof that Hailey Bieber does everything that Selena does, ” accuses Hailey of only filming a YouTube video about her fashion style throughout the years because she was inspired by one that Selena filmed with Vogue."

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 21:55:27,TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew Appeared Before Congress And Now The Fan Edits Are Rolling In,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adeonibada/tiktok-fancams-congress-shou-zi-chew,Environment,"Video collages and thirsty comments dedicated to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew have begun to pop up on the platform following the CEO's testimony to Congress yesterday, when he spent five hours defending the platform in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

On TikTok, fan edits dedicated to the 40-year-old have declared him “TikTok daddy” and “the finest ceo of our generation.”

Chew was in the hot seat fielding questions from lawmakers on the future of the popular video-sharing app, which currently has over 150 million monthly users in the United States alone.

Both Democratic and Republican politicians have expressed concerns over the app’s China-based parent company and what it means for user safety, data privacy, and national security. Some lawmakers have called for the platform to be banned in the US over worries that its parent company, ByteDance, could or would share American user data with the Chinese government. In his testimony, Chew said there was no evidence the Chinese government had ever accessed user data.

“Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,” Chew said in the written statement that started his testimony.

There are currently three bills in Congress that could affect American access to TikTok. Two would legislate an outright ban of the platform, while the other would give the government the power to ban any technologies that are deemed a national security risk.

Yesterday’s hearing put the TikTok CEO in the spotlight as he asserted banning the app would be harmful to millions of American businesses, and that a new subsidiary named Project Texas would provide a meaningful solution that would allow the app to remain active in the US.

While lawmakers looked to be unconvinced, Chew’s defense of the application, including his praise for subcommunities within the app, like “BookTok,” a community for people to discuss reading recommendations, seemed to strike a chord with those who have found inspiration on the platform.

Online, a growing group of creators appeared impressed by Chew’s performance despite the tense nature of the hearing and have shown their admiration in the most organic way: by creating fan edits and memes."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 20:09:00,Lana Del Rey Confronts Mortality On Her New Album,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/izzyampil/lana-del-rey-album-review-did-you-know-that-theres-a-tunnel,Environment,"Beneath her newly mature musings, the old Lana still exists. The best and worst of her musical career and persona beat from every song. Lana the seductor, self-obsessed and dramatic, flares up in scattered, biting lines: “If you want some basic bitch / Go to the Beverly Center and find her,” she scoffs on “Sweet.” And the line “Fuck me to death / Love me until I love myself” from Ocean Blvd’s title track would be right at home alongside “My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola,” that iconic phrase from Born to Die.

Lana the lover of Americana thrives here too, with references to John Denver, Rockefeller, and Ella Fitzgerald. Del Rey revamped her aesthetic in 2017, ahead of the release of her album Lust for Life. In her early career, she drew heavily from patriotic imagery, performing “ Born to Die ” in front of the US flag and cosplaying as Jackie Kennedy for the music video accompanying “ National Anthem .” After Donald Trump became president, she said it would feel “weird” and “uncomfortable” to continue romanticizing American symbols, but she never let go of an essential love for the pastoral and historical.

On 2019’s Norman Fucking Rockwell!, her most widely acclaimed album to date, she subverted this style so cleverly that Pitchfork declared her “the next best American songwriter, period.” She tempered her romance with a grim surveillance of a crumbling world, injecting fire, danger, and TV into her visions of a lovely landscape.

On Ocean Blvd, Del Rey makes a similar move, setting the vivid gorgeousness of the natural world against a constant thrum of mortality. On standout track “Fingertips,” she sings of an adolescence where “all I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and / Sit by the lake twisting lime into the drinks that they made,” conjuring an idyllic summer afternoon in her hometown of Lake Placid, New York. But then she sings, “Aaron ended up dead, not me.” She’s recounting the real tragedy of a real Aaron Greene. Later in the track, she tells her siblings, “Give me a mausoleum / In Rhode Island with Dad / Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave / Who hung himself high / In the national park sky.” This is another reference to a real death in Del Rey’s life; her uncle Dave died in Colorado in 2016, while she was on tour. It’s also an inimitable image, surreal and searing, vividly painted and quickly abandoned. It epitomizes Del Rey’s particular genius. She writes in quick, deft strokes; the simple additions of “high” and “sky” to the line about her uncle Dave make a straightforward depiction of death into a celestial scene.

But Ocean Blvd also reveals the twitchily defensive Lana, the one who posted a bizarre Instagram screed in 2020 where she complained of feminist hypocrisy. At the time, Del Rey wrote that she had been “crucified” for “glamorizing abuse,” even though other artists — she named primarily Black women like Doja Cat, Nicki Minaj, and Beyoncé — found success with songs “about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating, etc.” It was out of touch, and plenty of fans and critics told her so. But a trace of resentment still appears on the lengthily titled Ocean Blvd track “Grandfather Please Stand on the Shoulders of My Father While He’s Deep-Sea Fishing.” Calling herself “regrettably also a white woman,” Del Rey insists, “I have good intentions even if I’m one of the last ones.” Sometimes, she still writes like someone under direct attack.

Still, the overwhelming feeling of listening to Ocean Blvd — and it is indeed overwhelming, churning in epic swells of violins and rolling piano riffs — is one of grief. Del Rey’s grief for her dead relatives overflows into every corner of her life, loose and formless and urgent. It gurgles up to the surface at inconvenient moments, as on “Sweet,” where she and a lover have “been making out a lot / Not talking ‘bout the stuff that’s at the very heart of things / Do you want children? / Do you wanna marry me?” She seems increasingly aware of her limited lifespan, and of the significant milestones of adult life that are passing her by. On “A&W,” the sprawling, seven-minute lead single whose title stands for “American whore,” she deadpans, “Did you know a singer can still be / Looking like a sidepiece at 33?”

But Del Rey is 37 now, and surprised to find herself in an almost matriarchal role. When she celebrates her friends’ love, as she does on “Margaret,” named for actor Margaret Qualley, fiancé of her producer Jack Antonoff, Del Rey sighs, “When you know, you know / And when you’re old, you’re old / Like Hollywood and me.” She’s nervous. She wants to make sure the world remembers her; on the titular track, she pleads, “Don’t forget me.” But she’s not sure how to ensure her legacy, whether she’s up to the task of preserving herself through art or family. Turning to her sister, she asks, “Will the baby be alright? / Will I have one of mine? / Can I handle it even if I do?”●"
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 17:18:35,"Keanu Reeves, explained",https://www.vox.com/2019/8/16/20694479/keanu-reeves-revival-memes-history-explained,Environment,"It started in the pub, as all the best research does: Media studies professors Renee Middlemost (University of Wollongong) and Sarah Thomas (University of Liverpool) found themselves wondering where all the stars had gone. In an age of fractured media landscapes and niche celebrities everywhere, does anyone in Hollywood have truly universal name recognition and appeal? Does there still exist a public figure whose persona can unite and speak to fragmented audiences without excluding or alienating anyone?

Tom Hanks, they asked? Nah, too rooted in nostalgia. Leonardo DiCaprio? Or Denzel Washington? Maybe, but can you see either of them playing to a crowd of people steeped in video games or YouTube culture? Will Smith or Samuel L. Jackson? While their careers span decades, neither of them seems to have the current cultural staying power they once did.

But what about Keanu?

Ding ding ding.

Keanu Reeves has long been an icon, but over the last several years, he has reached a career peak — a period of activity that became known as “the Keanaissance.” Pop culture has exploded with a new respect for him at the precise moment that his career has been on an upswing. Beginning with the John Wick franchise, which kicked off in 2014 and is now on John Wick 4, released in March 2023, Keanu has reemerged in a huge way. The past years have seen him starring in a string of hits ranging from films like Always Be My Maybe and The Matrix: Resurrections to popular game Cyberpunk 2077. The Keanu resurgence has generated one think piece after another, each suggesting a culture enamored of his versatility and enduring career — but even more in love with his very human likability and relatability.

Keanu is a martial arts master, a romantic fantasy, a gaming hero, a relatable geek — one who’s reportedly in perpetual demand for superhero franchises — but he’s also still a fun-loving bro who sticks close to his bass-playing stoner roots. He’s even something of a Jesus figure, his renewed visibility reimagining him as a nigh-mythical force that has transcended any specific archetype. Through the Keannaissance, Keanu has become a true everyman: an actor, and a meme, for all seasons.

But what makes Keanu so different, so likable? And why did it take so long for cultural recognition of his talents to shift toward profound respect? Why is it that Keanu’s moment is happening right now, and in full force?

Middlemost and Thomas embarked on a quest to find out. In 2019, they issued a call for papers to their academic journal, Celebrity Studies, for a special edition focused entirely on Keanu Reeves. At a glance, there’s plenty in his filmography to discuss; there may be no one else at Reeves’s level who’s appeared in such diverse, culturally dominant films over such a sustained period of time. Reeves has made his mark in every film genre — and most of that work has made him progressively more endearing as a talented, relatable, fun, even wholesome celebrity.

What’s notable about the list of themes and sample topics in Celebrity Studies’ call for papers, though, is how many of them have nothing to do with Keanu’s tremendous film output and everything to do with “Keanu” himself. There are requests for pieces on “tragic Keanu” and Keanu-as-meme; Keanu as “reluctant celebrity”; Keanu’s relationship to queer and Asian American identities; and one topic that just says “authenticity and ordinariness.”

All of this tells us it’s not just Keanu’s roles that have made him into the modern era’s wholesome star: It’s also his offscreen persona. On Twitter, for example, 210,000 follow the account Keanu Doing Things, while on Reddit, 350,000 people are devoted to celebrating his general awesomeness. There, you can find recent stories like Keanu helping a lost stranger find her way, Keanu leaping out of a car to sign a fan’s banner and then pose for family photos, Keanu secretly donating millions to charity, and Keanu being as humble now as he was nearly 30 years ago, before he’d had any huge hits to his name.

Clearly, we’re waking to the discovery that the hero we needed has been among us all along — and what we learn about Keanu’s tremendous career revival can tell us a lot about the larger moment we’re in.

The seeds of Keanu’s current image were in his career all along

The Keanu we know today was with us from the very beginning — like the moment he drawled, “My daaaaad!” while beaming wholesomely at us in a 1983 Coke commercial, when he was just 18 years old. Here was an all-American boy who loved sports, loved his family, and, of course, loved Coca-Cola.

Born in Lebanon in 1964 to an English mom and a Chinese-Hawaiian dad, Keanu eventually settled in Canada with his family and began acting at the ripe old age of 9. He made his (hilarious) screen debut at 16 as an extra in a Canadian sitcom and wound up riding horses and juggling as a teen reporter for the CBC, among other things. Here he is getting attacked by a teddy bear.

Nearly three decades later, it wouldn’t seem out of character for Keanu Reeves to get attacked by a teddy bear today. That’s what’s striking about all these early roles — just how Keanu they all are. The Keanu Reeves on display in these early segments is the Keanu Reeves we know and love today, someone characterized in large part by his goofy, self-effacing demeanor, uber-chill attitude, and slow drawl joined with weirdly perfect enunciation. Keanu rarely appears to be acting in these early segments and roles; he’s just being himself.

Keanu continued to offer an air of unique authenticity during his breakout role in 1988’s Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure — the movie that gave us an indelible image of Reeves as a blissed-out stoner within whom resides the ineffable wisdom of a philosopher. In retrospect, it’s clear to us that persona came both from the scripted role of Ted and from Keanu himself. Take an appearance on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show, where he exuded the same Zen energy by taking a question intended to lampoon his Unlikely Mystic persona and turned it on its head by answering it seriously.

And in a way, that tiny moment — when the audience sets out to laugh at Keanu and winds up appreciating him even more — is a microcosm of Reeves’s second life as a public figure.

The Matrix made us start taking Keanu seriously. And we never stopped.

Keanu’s role as unlikely purveyor of Zen wisdom got its ultimate boost from The Matrix. If 1994’s Speed, in which he starred as an imperturbable bomb squad cop, embodied the optimism and humanism of the ’90s, then 1999’s Matrix, along with other iconic films from that year like Fight Club and The Blair Witch Project, marked a turn toward new-millennium unease. It also made Keanu Reeves even more relatable: There he was, stuck in the Matrix right alongside us, navigating a new era of technology and a host of looming existential questions.

The Matrix created a permanent link between Reeves and geek culture. His character, Neo, was the ultimate geek fantasy: an obscure office drone who morphs into a badass, leather-clad, kung-fu-fighting messiah. Because the Keanu we saw onscreen as Neo was so much like the reticent but philosophical geek we saw offscreen, it was easy, if you were a Matrix fan, to view Keanu as synonymous with his character — someone who was just like you but who had learned to manipulate and transcend the whole system, in his case by becoming the biggest action star there was while still retaining humility and grace.

While The Matrix inadvertently went on to become a tool for the most toxic internet communities, Keanu escaped all the contemporary negative associations we have with the film. Neo’s status as a Messianic figure, with all his innate spiritual wisdom, became associated with Keanu himself — and just as with Bill and Ted, it was impossible to know whether the role or the actor came first.

The increased focus on Keanu Reeves as a person superseded any discussion of whether he was a “good” or a “bad” actor. During the 1990s, when Keanu was still largely dismissed by the Hollywood establishment, he was in a string of flops and garnered three of his six Razzie nominations for Worst Actor and Supporting Actor. But by the aughts, it was becoming clear to all of us that Keanu Reeves doesn’t do “bad acting” or “good acting” but rather bends every part into the mystifying shape of Keanu. Is it intentional? Is it oblivious? It doesn’t matter; Keanu himself transcends the question of acting quality.

In 2005, Time observed of the Matrix star:

His voice has a certain forced, hollow depth, like a 12-year-old trying to sound grownup. His talent is hard to pin down, which is one reason a lot of critics think he doesn’t have any. But they’re wrong. ... Something about that mysterious reserve, the total earnestness, the unwinking way he commits to the most absurd scenarios, makes free falls from planes and wire-fighting cyberninjastics feel like a philosophy lesson.

Thomas agrees that the biggest shift in Keanu’s cultural reception after the ’90s was in how seriously audiences now take his image. “The Zen-action guy image has absolutely been around for years,” she said in an email. “But running throughout public responses to Keanu during those younger years was also a sense of not really taking him seriously. It’s the idea of the ‘whoa’ persona, or in those debates about ‘how good an actor is he really,’ et cetera — that there was something dumb and silly about him and his characters. But that image has also slowly been interpreted as genuine, vulnerable, and authentic too.”

In other words, the Keanu Reeves of 1983, 2003, and 2023 are all, more or less, the same Keanu Reeves. He hasn’t changed; instead, 40 years after his career took off, the culture has finally caught up to the idea that the actor who embodies some of our most rigidly masculine cinematic tropes — the badass action hero, the unstoppable cop, the martial arts master, the guy who levels up to save the world and get the girl — can also be a gentle, soft-spoken, wholesome dude who eschews those tropes in his own life.

The audience’s awareness of Reeves’s authenticity grew throughout the aughts — in 2008, the Guardian labeled him a “Teflon thespian,” implying that he was incapable of losing the public’s love despite a wide-ranging number of roles. “A long, long time ago, those of us who love Keanu Reeves decided that no matter how many dismal movies like Johnny Mnemonic he made, and no matter how inept his acting in A Walk in the Clouds, and no matter how inappropriate his casting in Much Ado About Nothing and Bram Stoker’s Dracula, we would never stop being thrilled when news of an exciting new Keanu project was announced,” declared writer Joe Queenan. “There was something about Keanu Reeves that we liked, and nothing could ever change that.”

We saw that phenomenon play out in early 2019, when Reeves actually had the worst box office opening of his career to date — for Replicas, a movie no one’s heard of, even though it opened on more than 1,000 screens that January.

The box office failure didn’t seem to deter Reeves, though; his fandom seems to be completely divorced from his box office receipts at this point. That’s because of Keanu’s longest-lasting role, which began to take off in the earliest days of social media: Keanu as meme.

Like all his roles, the meme version of Keanu and IRL Keanu fuel each other

Reeves’s saintliness was perhaps the earliest Keanu meme. Tales of his enormous generosity, alongside reports of him taking pay cuts and funding production budgets, became a self-perpetuating viral myth in the post-Matrix era. Like all Keanu’s real-life actions, these wound up fueling his meme persona; see this meme from 2008:

Keanu’s relatability, however, was what really put him on the meme map. Most famously came the Sad Keanu meme, which consists of a photograph, taken in 2010, showing Reeves eating a sandwich alone on a park bench. Not all of this was entirely invented by the internet; In 2011, Reeves coincidentally published Ode to Happiness, an illustrated book celebrating small ways of dealing with depression and melancholy. (The belief that Keanu is painfully lonely is sourced from a lie, but profiles implying that he does have issues with loneliness and depression have been with us for years.)

The Sad Keanu meme resonated because of its sincerity and, again, relatability: Keanu Reeves was just like us, eating a sandwich, lost in thought, having a bad day. The meme became so well-loved that it prompted the creation of Cheer Up, Keanu Day that same year. And it seemed to work: In 2011, Keanu was happy! Just like us!

Perhaps in conjunction with this positive counterpoint to the Sad Keanu meme, the 2010s began to proffer numerous stories of Reeves’s kindness, along with recirculating all the earlier stories of his on-set goodness and charity work. In 2011, he was spotted not only riding the subway like mere mortals but giving up his seat. Simultaneously, memes suggesting that Keanu was just like us in other ways began to circulate: Keanu is a geek, just like us; Keanu is humble, just like us; Keanu is perpetually respectful to women, as many of us would like to be. (He’s also immortal. Yeah, we can’t explain it either.)

“Publicly at least,” Thomas noted, “he’s not enamored by the trappings of fame — e.g., traveling on the subway, taking pay cuts, [being] bemused by his cultural resonance, etc.” Thomas sees this as a contrast to other examples of stardom that are “all about directly courting attention, fame, and materiality.” In other words, he’s wholesome. In a sea of wholesome memes, in fact, Keanu has somehow managed to transcend them all to become “the most wholesome person alive.”

The memetic amplification of Reeves’s good-guy real-life behavior has reached critical mass, in conjunction with his tremendous career revival — though for his part, he seems unaware of much of the buzz. He once told People he had no idea he’d been dubbed “the internet’s boyfriend” and described the honor as “wacky,” before adding that “the positivity’s great.” In 2023, he went a step further, gently breaking the news to us that he’s not perfect.

The moment is a handy encapsulation of the way his offscreen image has evolved through memes: He’s become someone who’s kind and generous but also someone who’s withdrawn, painfully human, self-aware about it, and still proactively seeking ways to be happy.

“In this contemporary media realm of very heightened performativity, construction, and commodification of the ‘authentic’, those stories and images all appear to convey a lack of performance, construction, and a genuine sense of selfhood,” Thomas said. “I think that to many people, he can come to embody one of the closest examples of the authentic self and star image around.”

Thomas also notes that Reeves has a unique ability to embody two very different ends of the star spectrum — the affable nice guy and the aloof cool guy.

“Coolness and aloofness doesn’t always come with this sense of ‘niceness’, vulnerability, and approachability,” she wrote. “Someone like Steve McQueen was always ‘too cool’ to really be vulnerable and approachable; Will Smith is almost too approachable to really sell the idea of deadliness and hardness; Hugh Jackman can do both, but does not convey that shyness and has very much swung away from steeliness as he gets older; Paul Newman played around with the ordinariness/extraordinariness to extremes as well, but always conveyed confidence with both, which Keanu doesn’t.”

This paradoxical, memefied version of Keanu’s authenticity, mixed with his strange reserve, set the stage for the role Keanu has most recently embodied: the ever-cool, ever-tragic John Wick.

In the era of John Wick, all the Keanus have converged into one transcendent Every-Keanu

2014’s John Wick was an unlikely hit because of its mid-tier production budget, lack of a star ensemble, and absence of huge marketing campaign, but critics hailed it as a major triumph both for Keanu as the title character and anyone who liked sleek, pure, slickly choreographed action cinema. (The Razzies even offered him the Redeemer award for actors who’d turned around their Razzie-filled careers with a great performance.) More importantly, John Wick shared traits Keanu had become known for in his post-Matrix life: his dry humor and his slick, cool persona mingled with a real, relatable sense of personal loss and sadness — all these things were there, plus dogs!

“The ‘hardness and deadliness’ of Keanu has come with age,” Thomas told me. “It isn’t there before [John Wick] in the same ‘authentic’ way, and both screen roles and what we know of his personal life (the tragic aspects of it) combine to give a sense of this as a believable trait.”

These elements helped fuel the cult love of John Wick, and arguably boosted Reeves into the public’s consciousness yet again. The film’s following spread rapidly, and when John Wick: Chapter 2 appeared in 2017, the audience for it was there; critics raved about it, and the box office take doubled that of the first movie. “The film’s status as a ‘little one that could’, taking on bigger-budgeted and bigger-hyped films, really linked into the star’s identity of the underdog ‘good guy,’” Thomas argued. By now, as she notes, “questions of, ‘Is he a bad actor?’ have greatly diminished in favor of, ‘look at how he’s really [doing] all those stunts and choreography in the John Wick films, especially at his age!’”

But while age hasn’t slowed Reeves down, it’s lent an obvious nostalgic element to many of his roles, past and present. 2018’s Destination Wedding reunited Reeves with Winona Ryder, whom he first co-starred with in 1992’s Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and got tongues wagging. Then there’s Bill & Ted Face the Music, the third sequel to Bill and Ted. What’s significant about these roles is that they’re actively nostalgic: Keanu is not a thing of the past, but rather an ongoing evolution. “He’s been around so long that he’s taken on a more symbolic meaning for audiences — connecting older ones with their own youths and reflecting on their own journeys through life and identity,” Thomas said.

In other words, the Keanu of the past is the Keanu of the present, and the Keanu of the present is also the Keanu of the real world as well as the Keanu of the screen. As GQ writer Alex Pappademas put it in his April 2019 profile of Reeves, “Every generation gets its own Keanu Reeves, except every generation’s Keanu Reeves is this Keanu Reeves.”

The Keanaissance, then, is arguably the convergence of all these different Keanus grabbing the spotlight before our eyes. First came John Wick, which reminded us that Keanu could still be the ultimate everyman: badass, soulful, worldly, and wise. Reeves’s subsequent cameo in Always Be My Maybe set the internet atwitter over his boyfriend potential. His 2019 appearance at gaming expo E3, when he arrived like a god descending to earth, was a geek culture bombshell. All of these things, combined with a series of offscreen viral moments and the revival of the “Keanu is awesome” meme, gave Reeves a renewed cultural omnipresence.

In addition to all of this, Keanu’s Asian American identity, subsumed through his longstanding branding as an essentially “white” actor, took center stage with his casting in Always Be My Maybe, a film with a predominantly Asian cast. This reclamation of his racial identity, combined with his ongoing status as a queer icon, thanks to his early role in the cult classic My Own Private Idaho as well as queer and trans readings of several of his other films, has also made him a vital part of the recent conversation around Hollywood diversity.

Keanu is emblematic of our new interest in reevaluating and reassessing what we value most in our most beloved actors. As we embrace and encourage diversity onscreen and off, celebrate nostalgic cultural touchstones, and scrutinize everyone’s public and private lives, Keanu is directly at the center of the Venn diagram of what makes a truly likable celebrity.

“It’s been amazing to be a small part in this international explosion of Keanu fandom,” Sean Welsh told me. Welsh organized the world’s first film festival devoted to Keanu, Glasgow’s KeanuCon, in 2019. “We had people travel from all over the UK and Europe to KeanuCon, and fans from across the world got in touch either begging for tickets or asking us to bring the festival to them next.”

Welsh speculated that the current wave of love for Keanu is due in large part to the public’s collective sense of camaraderie with him. “[He has] this communion with the audience that extends beyond [his] film roles.”

In other words, after a career full of one cultural ascension after another, from stoner mystic to mythical Jesus figure to badass action hero who just wants to be left alone to play with his dog, Keanu has now ascended to his final form by becoming an unlikely mythical Jesus figure himself. He simultaneously illuminates and evolves the very DNA of pop culture tropes while also bringing light to all who seek him — reminding us all that it’s still possible to be rich, powerful, and a self-aware good guy. Who also knows kung fu.

“Perhaps it was really only a matter of time before he ascended to internet godhood,” Welsh told me. “We probably only have a couple of years before he sheds his corporeal form to travel the cosmos as a boundless and benevolent emissary of humanity.”

Go forth, Keanu. Go forth.

2023-03-25,2023-03-24 16:13:18,Ocean salmon fishing ban off California and Oregon as stocks plummet,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/24/ocean-salmon-fishing-ban-california-oregon-chinook,Environment,"As drought dried up rivers that carry California’s newly hatched Chinook salmon to the ocean, state officials in recent years have resorted to loading up the fish by the millions on to trucks and barges to take them to the Pacific.

The surreal and desperate scramble boosted the survival rate of the hatchery-raised fish, but still it was not enough to reverse the declining stocks in the face of added challenges.

River water temperatures rose with warm weather, and a Trump-era rollback of federal protections for waterways allowed more water to be diverted to farms. Climate change, meanwhile, threatens food sources for the young Chinook maturing in the Pacific.

Now, ocean salmon fishing season is set to be prohibited this year off California and much of Oregon for the second time in 15 years after adult fall-run Chinook, often known as king salmon, returned to California’s rivers in near record-low numbers in 2022.

“There will be no wild-caught California salmon to eat unless someone has still got some vacuum sealed last year in their freezer,” said John McManus of the Golden State Salmon Association.

Experts fear native California salmon, which make up a significant portion of the Pacific north-west’s fishing industry, are in a spiral toward extinction.

Much of the salmon caught off Oregon originate in California’s Klamath and Sacramento rivers. After hatching in freshwater, they spend three years on average maturing in the Pacific, where many are snagged by commercial fishermen, before migrating back to their spawning grounds, where conditions are more ideal to give birth. After laying eggs, they die.

Already California’s spring-run Chinook are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, while winter-run Chinook are endangered along with the central California coast coho salmon, which has been off-limits to California commercial fishers since the 1990s.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council, the authority responsible for setting ocean salmon seasons off the Pacific coast, is expected in early April to formally approve its proposed closure of Chinook fishing along the coast from Cape Falcon in northern Oregon to the California-Mexico border. Salmon season is expected to open as usual north of Cape Falcon, including in the Columbia River and off Washington’s coast.

Though the closure will deal a blow to the industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs, few are disputing it.

“We want to make sure they are here for the future,” said third-generation fisherman Garin McCarthy, who described catching a Chinook as “magical”.

McCarthy, whose entire income last year came from salmon fishing off both California and Oregon, has had to invest thousands of dollars in equipment to fish other species like rockfish, halibut and black cod.

“We’re all scrambling to try to make our boats do something different,” he said. “We’re all salmon trollers. That’s what we do. That’s what we live for.”

Glen Spain, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, said he believed the ban might need to be in place for two or three years to bring back sustainable stocks after many fish died in 2020, the start of a record dry period.

The Chinook already faced challenges, with dams blocking their historic retreats to the chilly upper reaches of northern California’s Sacramento River and the Klamath River along the California-Oregon border. Decades of development have disrupted the natural flow of rivers and polluted waters.

In 2020, the Trump administration ended federal protections for millions of waterways, allowing for more water to be pumped out of the Sacramento River Basin for farming despite warnings from biologists that it could harm salmon runs in the future.

Fishers say river water temperatures increased with the diversions for irrigation, killing more eggs and hatchlings and preventing the stocks from bouncing back amid the drought.

In 2021, a judge determined the Trump administration improperly limited federal protections and restored them to a narrower 1986 standard. The Biden administration is expected to expand the protections in 2024.

Some are banking on the unusually wet winter to bring relief. Record rain and snowfall since late last year have freed two-thirds of California from drought. But too much water could also flush out eggs and hatchlings.

Businesses tied to salmon want the government to declare the situation a federal disaster so they may receive aid. As the market shrinks, more restaurants turn to farm-raised salmon, while gear suppliers stop stocking the proper equipment to fish Chinook."
2023-03-25,2023-03-24 15:54:22,The rise of the TikTok scold,https://www.vox.com/culture/23648715/tiktok-instagram-advice-mistakes-howto-tutorial,Environment,"Are you still drinking almond milk?

If so, a big subset of wellness influencers on TikTok and Instagram want you to know what a huge mistake you are making. “Stop consuming almond milk thinking it’s healthier!” commands Ashley Brooke, who describes herself as an entrepreneur, hairstylist, and artisan soap maker. “ONE CRAZY REASON YOU’RE DAIRY-FREE & FEEL LIKE CRAP,” blares wakeupandreadthelabels, an account maintained by food coach Jen Smiley. (The crazy reason, you may have deduced, is almond milk.) Paul Saladino, also known as Carnivore MD, demands to know, “why would you ever drink almond milk or feed it to your kids?” Posing shirtless with a carton of the stuff, he harangues the helpless viewer: “This is garbage!”

But it’s not just almond milk that is garbage. (For the record, current research suggests the beverage is fine for most people.) According to the scolds of TikTok — whose shouty expertise ranges far beyond diet to include fashion, beauty, parenting, and more — you might just be a garbage human, too.

Over the past three years, TikTok has evolved from a place to post and consume viral dances and memes into a destination for snappy, 20-second tutorials and how-tos, where everyone from dermatologists to divorce lawyers to amateur astrologers can dole out their expert — or, sometimes, totally inexpert — advice on relationships, sobriety, jewelry shopping, managing anxiety, buying plane tickets, lowering your blood pressure, and yes, cutting the dreaded almond milk out of your diet. According to TikTok, the hashtag #LearnOnTikTok had 521.2 billion views as of mid-March, a 103.4 percent increase over the last year; the hashtag #Tutorial had 321.8 billion views, a 59.6 percent increase. The effect is so pronounced that “TikTok is almost becoming the new Google,” says Shani Tran, a licensed professional clinical counselor and creator of the TikTok channel theshaniproject. Younger users, especially, are searching the app for tips on topics like email etiquette or finding a therapist.

Though the advice they uncover can be helpful (How to paint a sunflower! How to make candy apple slices! How to ask for a raise!), lately, it’s being delivered in a hectoring tone that implies the viewer has already made several catastrophic errors and is in dire need of remedial education. The scoldings show up in the hair-care dos and don’ts, like the one where a woman grimaces theatrically as she applies hairspray (don’t, obviously). It’s in the parenting video that admonishes viewers to “Stop traumatizing your kids” (by letting them watch YouTube). It’s in the “Fashion Mistakes that make you look completely STUPID” (wearing black shoes with a black shirt, apparently). Despite their aggressive stance toward seemingly minor infractions, such videos have become hugely popular. The hashtag #Mistakes has seen a 59.8 percent increase in views over the last year, while #DosAndDonts is up 71.4 percent.

“Unfortunately, negativity sells,” Tran says. “We as people can sometimes be drawn in by it.”

“At first it’s interesting, but then when it’s like every day, your feed is filled with people shouting advice at you,” says Emily Hund, a research affiliate at the Center on Digital Culture and Society at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication and author of The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media, “it starts to feel like everything’s a problem.”

Part of the reason scolding advice has become so ubiquitous on TikTok and other platforms is that it can make the scold seem more credible. Using “don’t do this,” “no,” and other negative language “authenticates your own identity as an expert” by denigrating other approaches, says Sylvia Sierra, a professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University who has studied social media discourse. “It can actually be a pretty effective strategy.”

It’s also perfectly calibrated to our particular historical moment, when many Americans are feeling insecure, adrift, and eager to shore up their self-esteem. In 2023, many people are grasping at normalcy, reentering social and professional lives that were, for several years, put on hold or curtailed. But the norms of this weird new world are fragmented and confusing; trends are as evanescent as the wind, and many Americans have forgotten how to dress (it’s no accident that so many advice videos are fashion-focused), how to work in an office, and how to socialize. “There’s just an opening,” says Sierra, “where people are looking to others for advice increasingly on what are the socially appropriate ways to behave.” A flood of influencers have rushed into that space to tell us what to do — in exchange for our attention, our self-respect, and, maybe, our money.

“Influencers have always offered this sense of control over an unruly environment,” says Hund. When they first emerged on blogs and later on Instagram in the late 2000s and early 2010s, that sense of control centered on the promise of economic self-sufficiency. Influencers had ostensibly escaped a job market upended by the Great Recession and had learned to make a living by taking trips, having fun, and modeling enviable lives that readers and viewers, too, could attain, with the right products.

The pandemic dealt a blow to that ideal as beauty and travel influencing became less lucrative (or downright impossible), and the influencer-as-bon-vivant was replaced by the influencer-as-expert.

Hund first noticed the shift during lockdown — a time when TikTok experienced a surge in popularity. Working from home with a young child, she was served a deluge of parenting videos on topics like sleep training and dealing with tantrums. The overall message, she recalls, was something like, “I know everything feels crazy, but I can help you at least manage mealtime.”

Everything did indeed feel crazy, and a lot of people were eager for someone to tell them what to do. “How do you navigate a pandemic and all of these political and social problems?” asks Hund. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, and it created the perfect opportunity for people to position themselves as experts online.”

Amid lockdowns, some Americans also suddenly had a surfeit of free time, and used it to pursue new hobbies, productivity hacks, and other forms of self-improvement — or at least felt like they were supposed to be pursuing those things. People sought out advice on everything from growing scallions to raising well-adjusted children, and influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers all the way down to self-appointed authorities with phones and a couple of minutes to spare sprang up to provide it.

Today, a curious scroller can find tutorials that are helpful, even soothing. But a lot of what pops up on TikTok — and Instagram’s competitor, Reels — takes a strangely censorious attitude to viewers. It can be a beauty video with an influencer’s face split in half, misapplied contouring under one cheekbone, correctly blended product on (not under!) the other. Or a dietitian telling you that you are, somehow, eating fruit wrong (it must be paired with protein and fat at all times).

There’s a simple reason content creators might be gravitating toward advice that’s full of red X’s and dire warnings: It gets views. Especially on TikTok, “controversial content does really well,” said Jessy Grossman, founder of the community Women in Influencer Marketing. “Drama-filled content does really well.”

The reason may have to do with the fractured nature of American society in the 2020s. “We don’t have common sources of news,” says Taya Cohen, a professor of organizational behavior and business ethics at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied shame. “We’re not watching the same TV shows.” Americans find themselves highly polarized into political and cultural subgroups, leaving people “trying to figure out what their identity is, who their community is, and what are the standards of their community,” Cohen says.

That’s where the scolding comes in. Guilt and shame are “moral emotions” that, in a sense, help teach us how to act in society, Cohen says. We may be seeking out shaming content now as a way of “figuring out what the social norms are,” Cohen says, and “what is the appropriate way to behave.”

There is, of course, another, darker reason we turn to such content: to feel a sense of superiority. Instead of watching videos to learn what not to wear or eat or do, some people may be watching “to feel better about themselves because, well, other people should feel ashamed or bad about what they’re doing,” Cohen said. They might be trying “to lessen their own feelings of shame about things they may have done wrong by favorably comparing to other people.” In other words, I might be a socially awkward, pandemic-addled husk of a human being, but at least I don’t tuck my sweater in wrong.

Advice-shaming videos are a venue where people “can indulge in thoughts that they wouldn’t want to admit otherwise,” Grossman said. Basically, viewers get to sit back and judge the people who are wearing the wrong outfits, buying the wrong products, feeding their kids the wrong foods — the don’ts.

Often, the appeal isn’t even just the video itself. It’s the fight playing out in the comments. “You’ll have an influencer that puts out a piece of content and it’s literally like opening the floodgates,” Grossman said. “It’s just like, ‘Get your popcorn and check out what’s happening.’”

There’s a psychic cost to consuming too much shame, however. Critical videos can validate our most negative thoughts about ourselves. “If you believe that you don’t look good in a certain type of clothing, and then you’re scrolling the internet and you come across a fashion person that says, ‘Hey, yeah, this type of clothing does not look good on people,’ that confirms the bias that you have,” Tran says.

Such content can also sow self-doubt. Since 2020, parenting advice on social media has gone from novel and interesting to feeling like it’s “invading my mind,” Hund says. “I started to notice myself thinking like, ‘Well, what did so-and-so say,” she added, “instead of knowing what I know about my child and how I want my house to be.”

Those feelings of uncertainty and self-loathing can drive us to consume more advice — and stuff — a doom spiral that leaves us awake at 3 in the morning obsessively searching Poshmark for pants that are not stupid. And because the scolds of TikTok are so popular, their content is taking over more of our feeds and becoming harder to avoid. “We can find ourselves sort of in this loop of re-creating, and then if the re-creating continues to get views,” Tran said, “now you have this channel that shames people.”

The most basic antidote is just to unfollow or swipe past anything that doesn’t serve you. “It’s obviously really important to be mindful of how it makes you feel” and to seek out content “with intentionality” rather than mindlessly scrolling, Hund says.

But that kind of mindfulness is often easier said than done. “It’s something that I am definitely guilty of not doing sometimes,” Hund acknowledges.

On a broader level, we might be less susceptible to feeling like a “don’t” if we had “greater public awareness of what influencers are and the nature of their work,” Hund says. Content creators aren’t just making shamey videos because we, the viewers, are disasters and need help. “They are doing a job, and they are understandably hoping to be remunerated for that job.”

That could mean views that help them get bigger and better brand deals. It could also mean direct sales of courses and coaching, an increasingly lucrative income stream for influencers. “If you have a big following and if you can get even 5 percent of them to buy your course for $50 to $200, that can bring you quite a significant amount of income,” Hund said. Many influencers offer snippets of advice on their channels in the hopes that viewers will then decide to pay them for more.

“It taps into that age-old advertising industry tactic of manufacturing a problem and then selling you a solution,” Hund said.

Indeed, this may be the most seductive promise of the TikTok scolds in our current confusing times — that there are quick fixes to life’s complex problems. Part of what’s appealing about dos and don’ts is their simplicity. If we just avoid these five mistakes, we can emerge on the other side — of parenthood, a job interview, a night out, a makeup routine, a relationship — unscathed. That promise is inviting, even if it’s illusory.

“We go to social media because we want to feel good,” Tran said. But sometimes we’ll settle for feeling bad in a different way, and maybe feeling shamed for something concrete and changeable is more manageable than facing the full reality of life in 2023: a shaky, uncomfortable, sometimes dangerous present, and an uncertain future we can neither predict nor control.

Recent speculation has claimed that Inter could land Kessie at the end of the season, in part due to Barcelona’s financial problems.

The report comes just after Kessie scored the winner against Real Madrid in El Clasico, bringing up Barca’s 3,000th goal in La Liga at the Camp Nou.

Kessie’s camp have made it clear that the Ivorian is quite happy and not thinking of moving on.

“We denied a possible transfer of Kessié, same for player and club — but fake news is annoying,” he said. “Possibility that Kessié may leave Barça in the next transfer market is the same as hoping that a snake may suddenly have legs next summer. “Kessié plays, plays wonderfully well, scores goals, enters Barça history by signing goal no. 3000 and someone finds the courage to divulge delusional information. “Franck has been clear, Barça too: he wants to stay.” Source | Fabrizio Romano

The former Milan man has had to be patient this season but injuries have allowed him some game time and he’s taken his chance.

Sunday’s goal against Madrid will live long in the memory as it ensured Barca went 12 points clear with just 12 games left."

Julian Strawther was having a night to forget on the offensive end in his first NCAA Tournament game in his hometown.

Then he created a moment that will be remembered forever in the West Regional semifinals.

Strawther had made just four of his first 14 shots from the field when he calmly trailed the ball down the court, caught a toss back from Hunter Sallis and drained a long 3-pointer with his back foot on the March Madness logo at midcourt with 7.2 seconds remaining. The shot sent Gonzaga to the Elite Eight with a wild 79-76 win Thursday over UCLA at T-Mobile Arena.

“A moment like that you can’t even make up,” the Liberty High School alum said. “For it to happen here in Vegas is just the cherry on top.”

”This is my city!” Strawther repeatedly screamed during the celebration.

Third-seeded Gonzaga (31-5) advances to play No. 4 Connecticut (28-8), an 88-65 winner over Arkansas in the first game Thursday, in the Elite Eight at 5:49 p.m. Saturday at T-Mobile Arena.

The dramatics erased a bit of a late meltdown by the Bulldogs. Gonzaga held No. 2 seed UCLA (31-6) without a field goal for more than 11:20 in the second half to open a 10-point lead with 2:40 left only to fall behind on Amari Bailey’s 3-pointer with 14 seconds remaining.

Strawther’s shot came on a play that looked an awful lot like the one made famous by Villanova’s Kris Jenkins in the 2016 national championship game victory over North Carolina.

But when Gonzaga coach Mark Few drew it up in the huddle, he did it with the idea of Strawther taking the ball at the top of the key and driving to the rim. Strawther asked if he had the green light to pull up and shoot it if the defense backed off, and Few gave him the thumbs-up.

It proved to be a good idea. Strawther’s shot swished right through the net and had both sides thinking not so much of the Villanova shot, but of the 30-foot game winner by Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs that beat UCLA in a 2021 Final Four game.

“UCLA has the heart of a champion,” Few said. “Fortunately we were able to hold them off. Julian hit a big shot, just like his buddy Jalen did a few years ago.”

After the shot, Strawther ripped the ball from the clutches of Tyger Campbell on the other end and made one of two free throws with 1.1 seconds on the clock. Campbell’s desperation heave hit the backboard and the rim before falling to the court and triggering a celebration as Strawther’s teammates encircled the hero.

It wasn’t long before Strawther found his family in the front row and embraced his father, Lee.

“You dream about that all the time from the time he’s little,” Lee Strawther said. “In the driveway, at the gym. He’s practiced that too many times to count. It’s every player’s dream to be in that situation.

“Then on a tough shooting night for him, he doesn’t care. He stepped up and took the shot. That’s a testament to him. He has confidence.”

Strawther finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. He had just two points in the first half as the Bulldogs struggled to find their game.

It was Drew Timme who kept them afloat. He looked every bit the part of the best player in the nation with 36 points and 13 rebounds, including 19 points on 9-for-15 shooting in the first half.

“It took a great player in Timme, a 35-foot shot and a tough whistle to send us home,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said.

Gonzaga trailed 46-33 at the break because it had committed nine turnovers to just one for UCLA while allowing the Bruins to shoot 51 percent from the field.

The Bulldogs chipped away and trailed 59-52 with 12:34 remaining when they dug their heels in and clamped down on the defensive end. Gonzaga forced UCLA to miss its next 11 shots from the field and held the Bruins without a field goal until Jaime Jaquez Jr. hit a layup and was fouled with 1:14 to play.

Gonzaga still led by six at the time and didn’t expect to need Strawther’s heroics.

“That was one shining moment,” he said. “That’s the best way to describe it.”

If Gonzaga would have lost to UCLA on Thursday night, Drew Timme’s final shots in a Bulldogs jersey probably would have been the two free throws he missed with 25 seconds to play.

But instead of leaving T-Mobile Arena with a loss, he left having played the greatest game of his career.

We’ll see what he has in store for Connecticut on Saturday with a trip to the Final Four at stake.

Timme extended one of this century’s great college basketball careers, finishing with 36 points and 13 rebounds in a 79-76 victory over UCLA before an announced crowd of 18,544 — the first in Las Vegas to see the West Regional semifinals.

The masterpiece paved the way for hometown hero Julian Strawther’s game-winning triple in the final seconds while doubling as Timme’s 10th 20-point game in NCAA Tournament play.

No player has more — or a more memorable mustache than the 6-foot-10-inch senior from Richardson, Texas.

“I’m not speechless a lot of the time,” said Timme, twice the West Coast Conference’s Player of the Year and the witty host of the “Gimme Timme Podcast.” “But I’m pretty speechless after that.”

Rest assured, he wasn’t the only one.

‘Time and time again’

Timme’s four years at Gonzaga feel more like 14. But he’s only 22, though his post play suggests otherwise. He’s tormented WCC defenders with a variety of pivots, spins, jump hooks, good ol’ fashioned overpowering backdowns and up-and-unders — more and more resembling a modern Kevin McHale in a sport seeping further and further beyond the 3-point line.

The Bruins aren’t exempt despite their Pac-12 pedigree, guaranteeing with their loss that the Conference of Champions still hasn’t claimed a championship in men’s basketball since 1997.

Timme poured 25 points on them in the Final Four as a sophomore and added 18 points and eight rebounds last season in Las Vegas. They knew what was coming Thursday and were still more helpless than ever before.

Defenders were fodder for his feast beneath the basket, and when he wasn’t dominating down low, he wouldn’t hesitate to grab a rebound and go.

He even hit a 3-pointer for good measure because the sport, after all, is seeping further and further beyond the 3-point line.

“He’s been remarkably consistent his entire career at just — he just delivers,” Bulldogs coach Mark Few said Wednesday. “He delivers, and this year our first 10 or 15 games we’ve leaned on him as hard as we’ve leaned on anybody, even in guarantee games we were in trouble and had to throw him the ball 12 straight times to eek out a seven-point win.

“I would argue you have to be every bit as tough and a little bit tougher to consistently deliver night in and night out when the opponent is trying to stop you with everything they’ve got. Double teams, their best defender, fouling, anything. And he’s just been able to rise to that occasion time and time again.”

‘Somehow, some way’

As they did Thursday. And as he did again, making 16 of 24 field goals to buoy the Bulldogs against a grizzled UCLA squad, against whom they overcame a 13-point halftime deficit.

The Bulldogs are in the Elite Eight for the fifth time since 2016, meaning they’re three wins from their first national title. Timme was a sophomore in 2021 when they fell to Baylor in the championship game.

The only thing he hasn’t done is capture the national title, something he can still fulfill to cap his final season in Spokane, Washington.

“We just got hit in the mouth, and we had to battle and fight. … We just rallied,” said Timme, averaging 21.5 points and 7.5 rebounds. “Somehow, some way, we dig deep and find a way to just come together and rally. That’s the beauty of this team. We may be down, but we’re not out.”

Respect Gonzaga.

Respect the mustache.

For the second time in three years, the Bruins lost to Gonzaga.

Not again. Not again. Not again.

Two years later, another deep Gonzaga dare.

Two years later, another desperate UCLA stare.

Two years later, another dagger.

This can’t keep happening, can it? Gonzaga can’t keep beating UCLA in the final seconds of an NCAA tournament game with a basket out of nowhere, can it?

The unimaginable became real. The unthinkable became the incredible. The worst kind of UCLA history just repeated the hell out of itself.

With six seconds left in their Sweet 16 brawl Thursday at T-Mobile Arena, moments after the Bruins had fought back from a second-half collapse to take a one-point lead, Gonzaga’s Julian Strawther hit a 32-foot jumper from the top of the key to steal an unbelievable win, smother a raucous crowd, and stoke the sorriest of memories.

Dancing Zags. Crumpled Bruins. Season over. Just like that.

On the verge of victory against their most bedeviling of rivals, UCLA had suffered a 79-76 loss to end their real national title hopes with the rerun of a heartbreak.

“He hit a big shot,” said a pale and weary Jaime Jaquez Jr. “And we lost.”

Bruins fans have heard this before.

Two years ago, in the final second of overtime in the national semifinals, the Zags’ Jalen Suggs hit a 40-footer to do the exact same thing, and how incredibly weird and unimaginable is that?

Although, two years ago, UCLA was a big underdog and the daunting defeat was the beginning of a three-year trek back to national relevance.

Thursday was different. For the senior trio of Jaquez, Tyger Campbell and David Singleton, it was not an exciting beginning, but the unsightly end of the road.

These Bruins were favored. These Bruins had taken a 13-point halftime lead. These Bruins had taken a one-point edge six seconds before Strawther’s shot on a three-pointer by freshman Amari Bailey.

Unlike two years ago, by being outscored by 16 points in the second half, the Bruins flat blew this game.

Their fight, so powerful for so long, suddenly faded.

Their teamwork, so smooth for so many seasons, suddenly broke.

Their experience, so important for this veteran team seemingly headed to the Final Four, suddenly deserted them.

After brilliantly racing to that halftime edge, UCLA stumbled, staggered and finally collapsed in a loss that ended with Strawther’s bomb but actually occurred long before that.

A game that was seemingly in control careened into the darkest of ditches in the last 20 minutes with the Bruins having no idea how to save themselves. A gleaming effort became a smoking wreckage filled with bricks, bad defense and regrets.

They couldn’t make a shot, missing 11 straight at one point in the second half, going 11 minutes, 16 seconds without a field goal.

“We ran some really good sets ... we got some really good looks ... we just weren’t able to knock them in,” Campbell said.

UCLA couldn’t stop Gonzaga’s veteran center Drew Timme, as he owned them for 36 points and 13 rebounds.

Said Timme: “We’re warriors.”

Said Jaquez: “We tried our best to stop him, we didn’t get it done.”

The Bruins stopped sharing the ball, jacking up wild shots in hastened possessions. They stopped battling for second chances, submitting to the equally tough and veteran Zags.

“Lot of open shots didn’t go down ... wide-open shots,” said coach Mick Cronin, who also complained about the officiating. “We got a very tough whistle.”

Maybe the injuries finally caught up with them.

Their best defensive player was wheeling around on a scooter. Their best big man was sitting on the bench in street clothes. They were counted out when they lost Jaylen Clark for the season and were counted out even more when they lost Adem Bona for chunks of this tournament and guess what? Maybe the experts were right.

Bona would have guarded Timme. And Clark, not a wandering freshman Dylan Andrews, would have guarded Strawther tighter before that winning shot.

But maybe it was more than the injuries. Maybe Jaquez and Campbell finally grew weary of shouldering the heaviest of loads, as they shot a combined 17 of 41 from the field. In particular, Campbell and Singleton didn’t make a basket in the second half.

Gonzaga was feared as a UCLA-deflating powerhouse, with a nation-leading 11 consecutive wins and the kind of veteran talent that would severely test UCLA’s resolve.

Sports Full coverage: 2023 NCAA basketball tournament March Madness is upon us. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2023 NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments.

Turns out, that’s exactly what happened.

The Bruins finished the first half with a 46-33 lead and a 9-1 edge in the turnover battle with an amazing seven steals.

But Gonzaga fought back in the second half, riding Timme and Malachi Smith, winning the battle underneath, tying it at 59-all midway through the half.

UCLA was suddenly missing everything. Gonzaga was suddenly grabbing everything.

Smith hit a floater that gave Gonzaga a 61-59 lead with 8:52 left and suddenly the cries of “U-C-L-A” from a Bruins crowd that dominated the building were replaced with, “Let’s Go Zags!”

The battle raged for those final eight minutes, Gonzaga actually taking a 10-point lead before Jaquez repeatedly drove and scored and brought UCLA back. Almost. Six seconds left.

All that was left was for a Gonzaga guard to throw in a miracle from the deep and hurl UCLA into the depths.

Again? Again."
2023-03-24,2023-03-24 05:14:25,Jubilation turns into heartbreak as UCLA loses to Gonzaga again in NCAA tournament,https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2023-03-23/ucla-basketball-gonzaga-ncaa-tournament-sweet-16-recap,Sports,"UCLA guard Amari Bailey walks off the court as Gonzaga celebrates its 79-76 win over the Bruins in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament on Thursday night.

From on top of the college basketball world to deflated, momentarily back on top only to be heartbroken once more.

There couldn’t have been a bigger swing of emotions than UCLA experienced in the span of a few breathless minutes Thursday night at T-Mobile Arena. That it came against a most aggravating antagonist compounded the agony.

The severely short-handed Bruins lost a 13-point lead to Gonzaga early in the second half of their NCAA tournament West Region semifinal, falling behind by 10 with just 2 minutes 40 seconds left. They stormed back, surging ahead by one on Amari Bailey’s fearless three-pointer with 14 seconds left.

All that, only to be undone by another dagger shot through the heart.

Two years after Jalen Suggs, there was Julian Strawther.

Trailing his teammates, Strawther took a flip pass from Hunter Sallis and buried a 32-footer with six seconds left to lift third-seeded Gonzaga to a 79-76 victory over the second-seeded Bruins.

Amid the silent devastation of UCLA’s locker room, all the Bruins sat at their lockers wearing blank stares to go with the game jerseys they did not want to take off a half hour after the game ended.

“It’s pretty hard, coming back like that,” UCLA point guard Tyger Campbell said of not being able to complete the comeback in what might have been his final college game. “Yeah.”

UCLA (31-6) had two last chances to save its season. It couldn’t convert either.

His team down by two points, Campbell had the ball stripped for a rare turnover and the Bruins fouled Strawther, who missed the first free throw before making the second with three seconds left. The Bruins’ inbounds pass went to big man Kenneth Nwuba at midcourt, where he flung a pass to Campbell for a three-pointer at the buzzer that was off the side of the rim.

For the second time in three years, the Bruins’ season ended in the cruelest fashion against the same opponent. For a tantalizing moment, it had seemed they might have persevered through it all. That late 10-point deficit quickly disappeared thanks to a 14-3 run ending in Bailey’s three.

“All I was thinking was, get a stop,” Bailey said. “I mean, that’s what got us back in the game.”

Gonzaga called timeout. The Bruins realized they had not accomplished anything.

“I mean, there’s 12 seconds left on the clock,” UCLA senior forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. said after finding his form anew in the final minutes and finishing with 29 points and 11 rebounds. “This is March. Anything can really happen.”

And did. UCLA coach Mick Cronin lamented that his defenders sagged off Strawther on his last shot after playing him tightly all game. After exhaling deeply, Gonzaga (31-5) will face fourth-seeded Connecticut in the regional final Saturday after the Huskies routed Arkansas by 23 in the earlier semifinal.

What started so well couldn’t have ended any worse for UCLA. Before their late push, the Bruins missed 11 consecutive field goals over an 11-minute stretch. Campbell and shooting guard David Singleton combined to miss all nine of their shots in the second half.

By the time Jaquez made a driving layup and was fouled with 1:14 left, his team was down 72-66 and in desperation mode.

“Coach was telling us we have to score on each possession or the game’s over,” Singleton said, “so that’s what we did.”

The Bruins were outshot, 47.2% to 30%, in the second half while giving up 14 offensive rebounds and 18 second-chance points. Gonzaga’s Drew Timme was a bulldozer around the basket, finishing with 36 points and 13 rebounds.

Jaquez’s big night was supplemented by Bailey (19 points) and Campbell (14 points, nine assists). It wasn’t enough for a team facing a deficit of sorts before tipoff. His team already missing top defender Jaylen Clark because of a leg injury, Cronin also did not play freshman center Adem Bona after he aggravated his shoulder injury against Northwestern in the second round. Backups Nwuba and Mac Etienne struggled to defend Timme amid a series of pump fakes and drop steps leading to easy baskets.

In the game’s early going it looked like the Bruins might end their Gonzaga hex, the Zags having prevailed in the last two NCAA tournament meetings between the teams in addition to a 20-point rout here last season. Cronin had shielded himself from the memory of Suggs earlier this week when he rewatched the 2021 Final Four loss, pressing pause before Suggs’ 40-footer banked off the backboard and through the net.

In a huge surprise, the teams played a frenetic first half and the pace favored UCLA. That’s because the Bruins were doing most of the running, their nine forced turnovers leading to 15 points.

Campbell pumped both arms in excitement after missing a jumper in the final seconds of the first half, an acknowledgment of his team’s nearly perfect play. The scoreboard told the story: UCLA 46, Gonzaga 33.

The lead would not hold up, Gonzaga finding more March magic. For the Bruins, there was only more suffering to come against the team that has delivered so much this time of year."

(Ellen Schmidt/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @ellenschmidttt

A loud chorus of screams could be heard every few minutes in the media tent set up outside T-Mobile Arena for this week’s NCAA Tournament West Region games.

Locals quickly identified the noises as passengers on the roller coaster at New York-New York, a ride that could provide some symbolism for the Arkansas season that ended Thursday.

A promising season of wild swings for the Razorbacks came to end with a resounding thud as the eighth-seeded Razorbacks were never in the game and got eliminated with an 88-65 loss to fourth-seeded Connecticut in the first-ever NCAA Tournament game in Las Vegas.

“You never want to go out like that,” senior forward Kamani Johnson said. “That’s not what we do here.”

Arkansas entered the season as a top-10 team with several NBA prospects and massive expectations. The Razorbacks maintained their ranking until mid-January when injuries and the rigors of conference play started to take their toll and contributed to a four-game losing streak.

But the Razorbacks started to look the part of national contender again at just the right time, leading to wins over Illinois and top-seeded Kansas in the NCAA Tournament. The victories started to remind Arkansas and the rest of the college basketball world just how much talent was on its roster.

Then came Thursday night.

“At the end of the season, we were playing decent ball,” Johnson said. “We just fought through a lot this year. And it didn’t end how we wanted it to. But we fought. That’s all I can say, we fought.”

While the box score doesn’t always tell the story, it takes only a quick glance to see why Arkansas is headed home and Connecticut will play for a berth in the Final Four on Saturday.

The Huskies shot 57 percent from the field and 45 percent from 3-point range, making all nine of their long-range shots in the first 29 minutes of the game.

Connecticut also won the rebounding battle, 43-31.

“They did a great job rebounding the ball for the entire 40 minutes,” coach Eric Musselman said. “And uncharacteristically we did not defend at the level that we have for most of the year.”

UNLV tournament appearance

UNLV guard Jordan McCabe would have loved to be playing in an NCAA Tournament game Thursday.

Instead, he had to instead settle for a spot with the media schlubs sitting courtside.

McCabe was working with Bleacher Report as an on-site correspondent.

“I have a chance to step out of my comfort zone and work on the media side,” he said. “It’s a lot of fun.”

McCabe was pleased to be a part of what he considered a pivotal moment for the city.

“It’s great to have the Sweet 16 here,” he said. “Events like this really show how much of a draw Las Vegas is. It’s growing into the sports mecca of the world, and I don’t know if there’s any place better to be right now than Las Vegas.”

On the scene

Raiders owner Mark Davis was among the fans taking in the historic night of basketball.

Comedian Bill Murray was also seated near the court, cheering on Connecticut. His son Luke is an assistant coach on the staff.

UNLV legend Anderson Hunt was in attendance and posted on Twitter his appreciation for a fan who he saw wearing his jersey from the glory days of the Rebels.

“I didn’t know how much Love people from other schools still have for UNLV (basketball from the) late 80’s early 90’s!!,” he wrote. “Wow and Thank you!”

2023-03-24,2023-03-24 04:55:13,Clippers take control second half to beat Thunder without Paul George,https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-03-23/clippers-vs-thunder-nba-game-recap,Sports,"Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, center, shoots as Clippers center Mason Plumlee, left, and forward Kawhi Leonard defend during the first half on Thursday at Crypto.com Arena.

The image that returned from the scan of Paul George’s injured right knee provided about as good of news as the Clippers could have hoped: George’s awkward land Tuesday after grabbing a rebound did not damage any ligaments — and the All-Star forward is not expected to need surgery, either.

What isn’t any clearer is whether George could be available during the playoffs.

With only three games separating fourth through 12th in the Western Conference standings entering Thursday, there is no guarantee whether the Clippers will advance directly to a seven-game first-round series or fall back into the play-in tournament. How long the Clippers stay alive matters for any potential return to action.

George is wearing a brace on his sprained right knee and using a crutch while he rests for the next two to three weeks, a timeline that is likely to result in George missing the rest of the regular season, which ends April 9. After that his mobility will be reassessed by the team, and should he be cleared, a ramp-up period would begin. Within the team, there is a belief that it might be overly optimistic to believe George could be ready by the first round.

Clippers teammate Terance Mann took the diagnosis as “definitely better than what it could have been” after watching George’s right knee bend backward.

“Everybody’s kind of feeling better about it,” Mann said, “and knowing that we could potentially get him back is good.”

So was their response without George on Thursday at Crypto.com Arena.

After a stagnant second quarter that left the score tied at halftime, the Clippers controlled the second half en route to a 127-105 win behind Kawhi Leonard’s surgical shooting and stellar bench contributions from players such as Bones Hyland, who will see their responsibilities increase with George out.

“Missing a guy like that, the ball is going to be in my hands more and everybody else as well,” Leonard said. “One man can’t win these basketball games. Still going to have to come in with a group effort.”

The Clippers (39-35) are 5-2 this season in games when Leonard has played but George has not.

“This is a really good win for us,” coach Tyronn Lue said. “We needed it.”

Leonard made 13 of his 15 shots for 32 points, adding six points and six rebounds. Russell Westbrook rebounded from a four-turnover first half to score 24 points, with seven assists, while making eight of his 13 shots.

Success without George, whom the Clippers alternately described as both disappointed but also in good spirits, will require replicating the hallmarks of the second half and avoiding the missteps of the first.

At halftime, the Clippers had nine turnovers and allowed eight offensive rebounds. After, they committed just four and gave up just five. Before, the offense had dragged. After, with Mann and Hyland’s energy, the Clippers played with a pace that Lue said must be a hallmark of every remaining game. Leonard, after 15 points in the first quarter, didn’t attempt a shot in his seven second-quarter minutes. Then he scored 15 more in the third quarter.

Carrying on will also require the Clippers’ reworked starting lineup, which includes guard Eric Gordon in George’s spot, to find its footing — and quickly.

Lue credited this win to a bench that “changed the game for us.” Hyland, playing for the first time in eight games, scored 16 points and injected life into the lineup to turn a seven-point first-quarter deficit into a seven-point lead. As Hyland recaptured playing time, Nicolas Batum recaptured his shooting stroke by matching Hyland’s four three-pointers for 12 points. The Clippers won Batum’s 18 minutes by a stunning 34 points, and the Clippers outscored the Thunder by 32 with Hyland on the floor.

“Guys who haven’t been playing like myself, just come in and be the guy who provides the spark,” Hyland said. “PG went down, it’s a sad moment but PG will be back out there with us, but we got to handle business on the floor and keep tallying wins for PG.”

Hyland shined as part of backcourts with Westbrook and Mann, and Mann and Leonard, occupying a role that could go to Norman Powell once he returns from a shoulder injury.

On offense, the Clippers were 8.8 points better per 100 possessions with George on the floor than off this season, the team’s largest disparity.

And that means that, of course, the workload in George’s absence will increase especially for Leonard, who must be in “attack mode all night” on offense, Lue said, while also guarding opponents’ best players earlier in the game, a job George handled.

At a point when every game is critical for the Clippers to avoid falling into the play-in tournament, there remain two sets of games played on consecutive days — meaning two games that the Clippers could be without Leonard, too.

“In order for us to be good going down the stretch Kawhi is going to have to play at a high level,” Lue said.

“With PG being out and Norm being out, this is what we need from him every night.”"
2023-03-24,2023-03-24 04:54:51,Gophers' third-period flurry brings swift end to Canisius upset bid,https://www.inforum.com/sports/college/gophers-third-period-flurry-brings-swift-end-to-canisius-upset-bid,Sports,"FARGO — Seventeen years after its infamous first-round upset loss to Holy Cross in Grand Forks, Minnesota made sure to avoid a repeat in the Peace Garden State against Canisius on Thursday.

The top-seeded Gophers scored eight unanswered goals after trailing in the second period to claim a 9-2 win over the Golden Griffins in front of a sellout crowd of 5,061 fans at Scheels Arena.

Minnesota will play St. Cloud State on Saturday for a spot at the Frozen Four.

""It was probably the closest 9-2 game I've ever seen,"" Minnesota head coach Bob Motzko said. ""They have a 2-1 lead in the second and they're playing to their game plan.

""What I liked about us is we stuck to our game plan and kept getting pucks deep. We had to grind tonight because of how they were going to play.""

Two goals on a five-minute power play — after a major penalty and game misconduct were called against Canisius' Stefano Bottini for contact to the head of the Gophers' Jackson LaCombe — early in the third period allowed Minnesota some breathing room after a tightly-contested opening 40 minutes.

""It was a 9-2 hockey game. You can't hide from that,"" Canisius head coach Trevor Large said. ""It didn't feel like a 9-2 hockey game. It felt much closer.""

Jimmy Snuggerud and Brody Lamb each scored on the five-minute advantage to give Minnesota a three-goal lead.

Four more goals before the end of the night, including a hat trick from Bryce Brodzinski after his first would-be goal was disallowed when a review showed it didn't cross the goal line, reminded the crowd — heavily partisan towards the closer to home team — of the firepower Minnesota has in its arsenal.

""[The third period penalty kill] kind of gave them [a chance to be] tired the rest of the game,"" Brodzinksi said, ""and it showed after that five-minute major starting to take it up a little bit.""

Minnesota trailed 2-1 after the Griffins took their first lead of the night on a beauty from Nick Bowman early in the second period. The graduate forward dizzied a Gopher defender before firing a shot off the left post and in to give Canisius the lead 3:23 into the middle stanza.

""When you go up at that point in the game you're pretty excited, but I knew we had to move on from it because they're a good team, too,"" Bowman said.

""Really fun to be back in Fargo. I love it here,"" Huglen said. ""It was a closer game than we would've liked, but we got it done.""

A finish in front from Connor Kurth, despite a Griffin defender draped all over him, with 1:56 left in the second period punctuated a tremendous shift from the Minnesota third line, pushed the Gophers back in front with a 3-2 lead and, ultimately, was the winning goal.

In the first period, with two seconds left in their first power-play chance, the Gophers took the game's first lead when Luke Mittelstadt threw a shot from below the left circle off Canisius goalie Jacob Barczewski's leg pad and into the net.

It took only two and a half minutes for the Griffins to answer.

Seconds after Minnesota killed a penalty, Canisius' Daniel DiGrande one-timed a shot through Justen Close's five-hole to tie the game at one.

Minnesota will play two-seed St. Cloud State inside Scheels Arena Saturday at 5:30 p.m. for a spot in Tampa. The Gophers split a home-and-home series with the Huskies in early January.

As Visual Capitalist’s Govind Bhutada details, besides investors and jewelry consumers, central banks are a major source of gold demand. In fact, in 2022, central banks snapped up gold at the fastest pace since 1967.

However, the record gold purchases of 2022 are in stark contrast to the 1990s and early 2000s, when central banks were net sellers of gold. The below infographic (learn more here) uses data from the World Gold Council to show 30 years of central bank gold demand, highlighting how official attitudes toward gold have changed in the last 30 years.

This infographic doesn’t need much commentary. Central banks know all too well that they are currency debasing at record rates and are preparing for the eventual implosion. If they really believe that inflation is well in check, why are they buying so much gold?

If central banks are preparing for this implosion, shouldn’t you also do so?

Projects in the U.S. such as circular economy for textiles and metrics and tools for sustainable buildings encourage industries to take their downstream material usage seriously. While Argentina has not created a comprehensive plan to promote the circular economy, this presents opportunities as well as challenges. By learning from the circular economic policies and practices of the US and Europe, Argentina can integrate its push for renewable energy into a shift to a circular economy.

Positive steps have been made in the path to a circular economy in Argentina. In 2021, Buenos Aires launched the Circular Economy Network, which includes over 300 private and public sector entities that have come together to promote recycling efforts, reuse of resources across industries, and responsible consumption. The Sello Verde (Green Seal) represents positive waste management practices in government, residential, and commercial buildings and has been awarded to 142 institutions as of September 2022. Recycling has been growing within Buenos Aires. In 2015, 35% of residents reported they recycled routinely. By 2022, this number was over 50%. This was due in part to the recycling capacity in Buenos Aires, which doubled between 2016–2019. Other efforts done by the city over the past couple of years include regulating single-use plastics, which has reduced the usage of plastic straws by 2 million per month and reduced the use of plastic bags in shops by 500 million annually.

Work done by Arq. Marcelo Parodi M. demonstrates the impact that circular economic practices can have on the renewable energy sector. Parodi partnered with GENNEIA, the largest renewable energy company in Argentina, to find a secondary use for materials which were used in the installation of energy production areas. This included repurposing materials from their renewable energy projects. This collaboration led to the donation and recycling of 47 large wooden spools and 730 pallets. These were used in the creation of furniture for schools and communities. Along with furniture, this partnership donated wood, machines, tools, and supplies. Circular economic groups such as Closed Loop Fashion have taken a particular interest in the apparel industry in Argentina, which has included factory trips as well as meetings with manufacturers and local brands.

However, the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) partnered with several Argentinian government ministries to produce the Inventory of Policies Related to the Green Economy in Argentina report. This report found “there is no specific legislation on clean production in industry, or any regulatory framework (general standards) or specific regulations by branches or sectors.” The introduction of circular economic practices could provide economic growth for a sector that is in need of improvement. The report by PAGE found that “the recycling sector continues to be highly vulnerable, and it is the instance of the industrial chain with the highest predominance of informality, labor precariousness, low income, hazardous jobs, and even child labor.” Government policies which encourage the repurposing of valuable materials and mandate an end of life process for imported goods and manufacturing could increase value in the recycling sector. In its conclusion, this report outlined that the plans put forward in Argentina for environmental protection and sustainable development, including those for circular economic practices, have had a positive impact but have not resulted in the adoption of sustainability and circular economic practices as a core element of production planning in general or by sector.

Policies which encourage repurposing and re-use of materials can combat two of the major problems facing the recycling industry. The low recycling rate of manufacturing firms means that raw materials and energy demand remains high and continues to grow the environmental impact of waste generation. When asked for his thoughts on integrating circular economic practices into the private sector, specialist Arq. Marcelo Parodi M argued that these practices can provide businesses with a competitive advantage in the market, benefitting both the company and the earth. In the hopes of hastening the transition to a renewable economy in Argentina, PAGE has offered several recommendations. These include updating waste management legislation, growing the recycling sector to incorporate more recovered materials, and requiring public procurement processes to include sustainability criteria. These steps could provide Argentina with strong circular economic practices built on what they have already accomplished.

Do Kwon, a prominent crypto founder who was behind two digital currencies that crashed last year, was charged with fraud by U.S. prosecutors late Thursday, shortly after local authorities arrested him in Montenegro. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight The arrest, confirmed by local government authorities, capped a months-long search for the crypto entrepreneur, who once had a devoted fan base but lost the faith of many investors after last year’s crypto meltdown.

Authorities had believed that Kwon, the South Korean developer of the TerraUSD and Luna cryptocurrencies, went into hiding after his home country issued an arrest warrant for him in September. At the time, Kwon denied he was a fugitive in a tweet. But since then his once-active Twitter account has fallen silent.

Montenegro’s Interior Ministry said Thursday it “apprehended” Kwon and brought him and a fellow South Korean citizen to a prosecutor’s office in the capital city on charges of document forgery. South Korea had reportedly asked Interpol to issue a “red notice,” allowing other countries to provisionally arrest Kwon.

Later in the day, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York made public an eight-count indictment against Kwon in connection with his cryptocurrency business. The indictment charged him with various forms of fraud — including securities fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to defraud and engage in market manipulation.

Kwon’s arrest comes as much of the cryptocurrency market remains battered. Its boom started to fizzle last spring when Luna crashed and sparked broader crypto market turmoil that saw other firms collapse. The so-called “crypto winter” deepened in November when FTX, a crypto exchange, went bankrupt, and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was later charged with fraud.

Since then, other firms and crypto boosters have faced regulatory pressure, including the crypto exchange Kraken, which in February agreed to stop selling certain assets and pay a $30 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Just a day before Kwon’s arrest, the SEC filed a complaint against eight celebrities, including professional boxer Jake Paul and actress Lindsay Lohan, accusing them of failing to disclose their compensation for the promotions.

Both Terra and Luna took off among crypto enthusiasts and multiplied in value before ultimately crashing last year. Investors have said Kwon defrauded them in promoting the coins.

Before the crash, Kwon was well regarded, while his fans called themselves “Lunatics” after his token. He graduated from Stanford University and briefly worked for Apple before founding several crypto projects, including Luna.

Kwon’s case has been watched closely as governments around the world weigh how to prosecute cases involving cryptocurrency and how aggressively to pursue the entrepreneurs behind the coins. Among them is FTX founder Bankman-Fried, who is under house arrest pending a slew of civil and criminal charges brought against him by government agencies.

The recall of 571,000 SUVs and minivans across the United States comes after the Korean carmakers issued similar recalls just a year ago.

The Hyundai company logo is displayed on a car. AP

The potentially flammable cars include the 2019-2023 Santa Fe, the 2021-2023 Sante Fe Hybrid, the 2022 and 2023 Santa Fe Plug-in hybrid and the 2022 and 2023 Santa Cruz.

The only Kia model facing a recall is the Carnival minivan from 2022 and 2023.

The tow hitch harness on the recalled cars can catch fire while the car is parked – and even when the car is turned off — or driven.

There was one car fire and five vehicles damaged by heat tied to Hyundai while Kia reported no fires. No injuries were reported.

The automakers told US safety regulators water can get into the circuit board on the hitches and cause a short circuit.

Last year, Hyundai and Kia also told owners more than once to park their cars outdoors because they had the chance of catching fire. The carmakers have been dogged by fire and engine problems for several years now.

Owners of the latest recalled rides will be notified starting May 16 to take their car to a dealer for a free repair. The dealers will take out the fuse and tow hitch computer module before putting in a new fuse and wire extension with an improved connector that’s waterproof.

A brand-new gallery dedicated to retail objects that have bombed commercially opened earlier this month in Brooklyn’s Industry City complex.

The Museum of Failure collects “failed products and services from around the world,” according to its website, offering what it calls a “fascinating learning experience” into failed innovation.

“Every item provides unique insight into the risky business of innovation,” continues the site. “The museum aims to stimulate productive discussion about failure and inspire us to take meaningful risks.”

The Museum of Failure showcases more than 159 retail items that didn’t quite take off, including the infamous and much-reviled Google Glass and the ill-fated DeLorean car, which was made famous by the “Back to the Future” franchise.

Other items that made the museum’s not-so-hallowed halls include 1985’s Coke II — also known as New Coke and revisited in Season 3 of the mid-’80s-nostalgic Netflix series “Stranger Things” — as well as the 2003 Nokia N-Gage smartphone, which despite its failure in the US helped jump-start Finland’s mobile gaming industry.

Also in the sideshow of shame: Bic for Her pens, which were released in 2011 and whose only difference from other writing instruments was they were sparkly, bright colors.

Google Glass failed when consumers raised issues about the item’s price and lack of safety and privacy. Museum of Failure

The exhibit was curated by Dr. Samuel West, who holds a Ph.D. in organizational psychology and is a licensed psychologist.

The biggest obstacle to innovation, according to West, is the dread of defeat, which served as his inspiration for the traveling exhibit.

“My research is focused on helping organizations to be more innovative. And one of the big obstacles to innovation is the fear of failure,” said West told CBS New York recently. “So I was playing with this idea: How can I communicate the research findings and the importance of accepting failure?”

“It felt very ‘on brand’ for us,” Jim Somoza, managing director of Industry City, said of housing the unusual display. “We take a lot of risks doing a project like this and we have had a lot of tenants that are entrepreneurial who take a lot of risks and who have had their fair share of failures, but that have turned into successes, and it felt right.”

Tickets for the exhibit — set to run through May with a possible extension going into June — are available for purchase on the museum’s website."
2023-03-24,2023-03-23 23:30:00,Exclusive: Walmart laying off hundreds of US workers at five e-commerce fulfillment centers,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwtY29uc3VtZXIvd2FsbWFydC1sYXlpbmctb2ZmLWh1bmRyZWRzLXVzLXdvcmtlcnMtZml2ZS1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLWZ1bGZpbGxtZW50LWNlbnRlcnMtMjAyMy0wMy0yMy_SAQA?oc=5,Business,"













NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers at five U.S. Walmart facilities that fulfill e-commerce orders are being asked to find jobs within 90 days at other company locations, a spokesperson confirmed to Reuters.

About 200 workers at Pedricktown, New Jersey, and hundreds of others at Fort Worth, Texas; Chino, California; Davenport, Florida; and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania were let go due to a reduction or elimination in evening and weekend shifts, the spokesperson said.

The layoffs at Walmart, a retail bellwether because of its size, could be a harbinger of further turmoil in the U.S. economy, which many economists predict could enter recession this year.

Fears of an upcoming recession have already led retailers to announce 17,456 job cuts so far in 2023, compared with 761 in the same period last year, according to a March report by Challenger, Gray and Christmas.

Amazon, Neiman Marcus, and Lidl are among retailers cutting jobs, largely corporate staff.

""We recently adjusted staffing levels to better prepare for the future needs of customers,"" Walmart said in a statement, adding that it would work closely with affected associates to find jobs at other locations.

The spokesperson said impacted workers would be paid for 90 days to find jobs at other facilities, including those in Joliet, Illinois, and Lancaster, Texas, where the company has opened up new high-tech e-commerce distribution centers.

Walmart has been investing heavily in automation over the past few years, partnering with companies such as Knapp to help it cut down the number of steps it takes employees to process e-commerce orders to five from 12, which has been implemented at its Pedricktown, New Jersey location, for instance.

On a post-earnings call in February, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said he was ""most excited about the automation opportunity we have"" with plans to increase investments in automation technology as part of its more than $15-billion capital expenditure budget this year.

The CEO's comments followed a cautious full-year forecast from the retailer, which CFO John David Rainey said was down to a lot of ""trepidation and uncertainty with the economic outlook.""

Workers being laid off at the five fulfillment centers will be eligible for roles at Walmart's 5,000 U.S. stores, which the company has increasingly been using as a platform to ship orders to customers' doorsteps, the spokesperson said. Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States with about 1.7 million U.S. workers.

Apart from Pedricktown, New Jersey, Walmart did not post a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notice for the layoffs, according to a Reuters review of labor government data. A WARN notice is mandated by U.S. labor law and requires companies with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days' advance notification of plant closings and mass layoffs.

The spokesperson declined to call them mass layoffs and said that the warehouses continued to operate normally. The company did not issue a WARN notification for the other locations as it is unsure about the total number of employees that will be eventually laid off and re-hired, the spokesperson added.

2023-03-24,2023-03-23 23:16:58,"TikTok CEO faces bipartisan grilling over privacy, China ties and teens",https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-03-23/tiktok-ceo-faces-bipartisan-grilling-over-privacy-china-ties-and-teens,Business,"TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew faced a bipartisan baptism of fiery inquiry Thursday at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, held as the platform comes under increased scrutiny from lawmakers and the Biden administration.

The questions covered topics as varied as content removal bias against Black creators, election misinformation and the platform’s effects on the mental health of young people, who make up the majority of TikTok’s users. While many of these issues are not unique to TikTok, the Chinese ownership of its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, and its ties to the Chinese government make it unique among the major social media platforms popular with Americans.

The five-hour adversarial hearing saw a rare instance of bipartisan cooperation as both Democrats and Republicans raised national security concerns over the possibility of Chinese government officials gaining access to U.S. user data. Lawmakers made references to a 2017 Chinese law that requires companies there to assist state intelligence gathering.

“To the American people watching today, hear this: TikTok is a weapon by the Chinese Communist Party to spy on you, manipulate what you see, and exploit [it] for future generations,” Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican from Washington state, said in her opening statement.

Her sentiments were supported by the 52-member committee’s leading Democrat, Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey. “While TikTok videos provide a new fun way for people to express their creativity and enjoy the videos of others, the platform also threatens the health, privacy and security of the American people,” he said. “And I’m not convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks that it poses to Americans in its present form.”

In response, Chew, who is Singaporean, gave a robust defense of his company and sought to distance it from the Chinese government. “Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government. It is a private company,” Chew said in his opening statement.

He added that concerns about addiction and data privacy were an industrywide problem. “We believe what is needed are clear, transparent rules that apply broadly to all tech companies. Ownership is not at the core of addressing these concerns.”

Chew also outlined Project Texas, the company’s proposal to use Austin-based cloud computing company Oracle to vet its code and ensure that U.S. user data are stored in the country and firewalled from access by foreign governments. “This eliminates the concern that some of you have shared with me that TikTok user data can be subject to Chinese law,” Chew told the committee.

But there remains skepticism about the practicalities of that proposal and whether it goes far enough.

“Project Texas just doesn’t pass the smell test. My constituents are concerned that TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party are controlling their data and seeing our own vulnerabilities,” Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) said.

The hearing came after it was reported that the Biden administration plans to force ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok or face a ban in the United States. Ahead of the hearing, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese government planned to resist the forced sale.

“If the news is true, China will resolutely oppose it,” Shu Jueting, a spokeswoman at China’s ministry of commerce, said. She added that the sale “would seriously damage investors from multiple countries including China” and hurt “confidence to invest in the United States.”

Ahead of the hearing, a slew of TikTok creators roamed the halls of Congress as part of a public relations effort to urge lawmakers and the Biden administration not to ban the platform, which has 150 million users in the U.S. monthly.

Last month, the White House announced a ban of TikTok on all devices owned by federal agencies. The United Kingdom, Canada and the European Union have also banned TikTok from all government devices, citing security concerns. In 2020, India banned the use of TikTok in the country.

A sobering moment at the hearing came when Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) highlighted the story of a teenager named Chase Nasca, who died by suicide and whose tearful parents were in attendance. “Your company destroyed their lives,” he said.

“The content in Chase’s ‘For You’ page was not a window to discovery, as you boldly claimed in your testimony. … Instead, his For You page was sadly a window to discover suicide,” he said, referring to the curated section of the app for users.

Earlier in the session, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) showed a video in which someone appeared to threaten Chairwoman Rodgers with a gun.

“This video has been up for 41 days,” Cammack said. “You expect us to believe that you are capable of maintaining the data, privacy and security of 150 million Americans when you can’t even protect the people in this room? I think that is a blatant display of how vulnerable people who use TikTok are.”

After a recess, Chew said he had communicated with his team to have the video taken down.

The White House has already supported a bipartisan bill in the Senate that would give the Commerce secretary broad new powers, including to ban technology from adversary countries such as China and Russia."

Narasimhan, who took the reins as CEO earlier this week, said in a letter to Starbucks’ employees Thursday that he also expects the company’s leadership team to be connected and engaged in stores.

“While our performance is strong, our health needs to be stronger,” Narasimhan wrote in the letter. “We must care for the artists and the theater in the front of our stores and the factory in the back.”

Having a CEO work in stores is new for Seattle-based Starbucks, but not unprecedented among big companies. DoorDash CEO Tony Xu and his executive team make DoorDash deliveries once a month, for example.

Narasimhan, 55, issued the letter just prior to the company’s annual meeting, which was held virtually. The former PepsiCo executive has spent the last six months immersing himself in Starbucks, earning his barista certification as well as visiting stores, farms and manufacturing centers across the world.

CEO Laxman Narasimhan took the reins from Howard Schultz earlier this week. Starbucks

“I felt it was very important to start as a barista. I wanted to really understand what they do and how they do it,” Narasimhan said in comments emailed to The Associated Press. “I’ve loved and learned so much about the retail experience from working in our stores, and can now make an excellent French press if I do say so myself.”

Narasimhan said his first priority is addressing some of the company’s limitations. A reinvention plan announced last fall is updating equipment and layouts to make stores more efficient and increasing employee retention with better pay and benefits, he said. The average US Starbucks worker now makes $17.50 per hour.

Narasimhan said he would like to see Starbucks evolve into a more global company, be less wasteful and move with greater speed.

“My immersion provided me with exposure to every aspect of Starbucks business, culture, and brand,” he said. “Together, we have acknowledged the opportunity for a refounding of Starbucks.”

Narasimhan succeeds longtime Starbucks leader Howard Schultz, who came out of retirement last spring to serve as interim CEO while the company searched for a new chief executive. Schultz will remain on the company’s board.

Some investors were unhappy with that move, saying Starbucks should have had a more robust succession plan in place when former CEO Kevin Johnson retired last April. Among the shareholder proposals investors voted on Thursday was one that would require Starbucks’ board to begin succession planning at least three years before an expected transition.

Another shareholder proposal would require Starbucks to commission a third-party assessment of its commitment to workers’ collective-bargaining rights. That proposal came amid an ongoing unionization movement that Starbucks opposes.

Members of different labor unions joined Starbucks unionized employees for a labor protest outside Starbucks’ Seattle headquarters Wednesday. AP

At least 293 of Starbucks’ 9,000 company-owned US stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Workers have begun bargaining with the company but so far no store has reached agreement on a new contract.

The process has been contentious. Earlier this month, a federal labor judge found that the company violated labor laws “hundreds of times” during a unionization campaign in Buffalo, New York. The company is appealing.

On Wednesday, workers at more than 100 US Starbucks stores went on strike across the country, demanding that Starbucks come to the bargaining table and hammer out labor agreements. It was the third time that workers have held a nationwide strike.

Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing the workers, said it wanted to send Narasimhan a message that the CEO transition is an opportunity to break with the past and partner with the union. Schultz had a long history of opposing unionization.

But in his comments to the AP, Narasimhan struck a similar tone to his predecessor. He said Starbucks respects workers’ right to organize but believes the company functions best without a union.

“As a company, our experience is that a having a direct relationship with our partners is core to our culture and the experiences we create in our stores,” Narasimhan said. “I continue to believe a direct relationship with our partners is the best way forward.”

Starbucks said it would announce the results of the shareholder votes in the next few days."
2023-03-26,2023-03-26 06:09:39,Tim Draper recommends founders hold ’at least’ two payrolls ‘worth of cash’ in crypto,https://cointelegraph.com/news/businesses-should-hold-two-payrolls-worth-of-cash-in-crypto-tim-draper,Business,"American venture capital investor and entrepreneur Tim Draper suggested founders keep at least two payrolls worth of cash in Bitcoin (BTC) or alternative cryptocurrencies, along with other diversification recommendations, in response to the uncertainty created by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).

In a March 25 report directed at business founders, Tim Draper stated that Bitcoin is a hedge against a “domino run” on the banks and overbearing government intervention, adding that businesses “can no longer rely” on a single bank or governing body to manage their cash.

Draper suggested that business founders keep at least “6 months of short-term cash” in two separate bank accounts — one with a local bank and another with an international bank.

He noted that businesses should also have at least two payrolls “worth of cash” in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

These preventative steps were necessary, according to Draper, because for the “first time in many years,” governments are seizing control of banks, and governments themselves are “at risk of becoming insolvent.”

He further revealed that “many startups” sought emergency relief from him after SVB and other banks shut down.

Additionally, Draper emphasized the importance of contingency plans, as boards and management are responsible for meeting payroll deadlines “even in times of crisis.“ He added:

“It is important to build out contingency plans for bank failures that could happen more and more often if the government continues to print money and whipsaw interest rates to counteract inflation caused by the over-printing of money.”

Draper reminded founders to be vigilant against the risk of fraud, noting that fraudsters are skilled at identifying weaknesses in a system and exploiting them.

Furthermore, to prevent phishing theft, he advised founders to verify with all parties involved whenever there is a change in wire instructions or a new approval system.

This comes after recent news that Draper performed a self-composed Bitcoin song after his keynote speech at Paris Blockchain Week 2023 on March 22.

He said the song was dedicated to SVB and “all the banks that have failed and will fail.”

The song received a round of applause from the audience, with Draper concluding his time on stage by saying blockchain, Bitcoin and smart contracts make up one of the “greatest transitions in the history of the world.”"

But when you’re out on a road trip or you simply need to stop at Superchargers, there’s a way you can increase the speed of your charging experience, ultimately cutting down your costs for timed-use billing systems.

No matter where you charge your Tesla, it’s worth noting how a given Supercharger bills you, if you’re hoping to save money. Tesla owners may stand to save a significant amount of money at stations billed by the minute, and making sure you head to V3 Superchargers can have you out of there in as little time as possible.

Read this week’s Tesla Pro Tip from Erwin Meyer at EVSpeedy.com below to learn how to save money at Superchargers by increasing your charging speeds.

Increase Speeds, Decrease Costs

Most people obey the in-car navigation instructions, but the Tesla Navigation is quite conservative with charging planning, ensuring that you never run out of any charge under any condition. To increase charging speeds and decrease costs, you can try to use Superchargers with about 10 percent of charge. You should also try to prioritize V3 chargers if possible. Then, you should be able to max out the charging rate at 250 kW. This way you can add about 65 miles in 4 minutes, or 125 in 10 minutes. If your Supercharger is billed per minute, this will save you a lot of money.

In a March 26 Bloomberg report citing unnamed sources, it was claimed U.S. officials are pondering what support, “if any,” can be provided to First Republic; however, an “expansion of the Federal Reserve’s offering” is one of the options being explored.

First Republic was reportedly deemed “stable enough to operate” by regulators without the need for an “immediate intervention,” as efforts are made by the bank in the meantime to “shore up its balance sheet.”

The sources reportedly said that while the Fed’s liquidity offerings would be expanded in accordance with banking laws, which stipulate that it must be “broadly based” and not aimed at benefiting a specific bank, they also warned that the alteration could be “made in a way” that ensures First Republic Bank benefits.

It was reported that despite First Republic facing structural challenges with its balance sheet, “the bank’s deposits are stabilizing,” and it is not at risk of experiencing “the kind of sudden, severe run” that led regulators to close down Silicon Valley Bank. Sources added:

“It has cash to meet client needs while it explores solutions, the people said. That includes $30 billion deposited by the nation’s largest banks this month.”

This comes after the Fed announced a plan on March 19 to strengthen liquidity conditions through “swap lines,” which involve an agreement between two central banks to exchange currencies.

“To improve the swap lines’ effectiveness in providing U.S. dollar funding, the central banks currently offering U.S. dollar operations have agreed to increase the frequency of seven-day maturity operations from weekly to daily,” the Fed said in a statement

The swap line network, which involves the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and the Swiss International Bank, commenced on March 20 and is set to run until at least April 30."
